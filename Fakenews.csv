Unending fatigue in eThekwini municipality as excos disagress over appointment ,"Amidst the crises in the eThekwini Municipality, there has been a diversion from excos meeting to who will control the critical five committees and make it to the eleven members executive committee, with the two main factions in the region hoping to gain control. The two factions want to snatch the committees in order to influence the direction of the municipality and who gets tenders ahead of the eThekwini ANC regional conference, where money is expected to be splashed ahead of the conference. The five committees been referred to are: Security and Emergency Services, Community Services, Human Settlements and Infrastructure, Economic Development and Planning and Governance and Human Resources. These committees have direct access to the community which voice their issues for discussions. The chairs of these committees join the exco, which is the proverbial engine of the municipality. Being the majority party, the ANC have six members (including the mayor, deputy mayor and speaker) in committee and the rest comes from the Democratic Alliance and Inkatha Freedom Party. Xolani Dube, a political analyst from Xubera Institute revealed that the reason why there is competition for these positions is because the exco is like the cabinet of the municipality. Dube further explained that He said unlike in Johannesburg and Cape Town where there are executive mayors who have more powers than the city manager, in eThekwini, the mayor has a ceremonial role and he or she takes decisions after they have been recommended by the powerful exco. He said \""If you are in charge of the exco you have captured the engine of the functioning of the municipality, these are decision makers? All the decisions are taken by that committee.\"" The provincial leadership has reportedly tried to manage the situation by asking all the councillors of the ANC in the municipality to send their curriculum vitaes (CV) to the deployment committee. A source from inside the party said he decision to ask for the CVs was to ensure that the process is fair and only the best are appointed. the source said \""There will be no faction that will be able to take control of the exco because the process is being handled by the PEC which has asked all councillors to submit CVs in order to look at their qualifications.\"" Ricardo Mthembu, spokesperson of the ANC in KZN explained that the selection process which is under way would be done by Thursday when the municipality convenes a full council to elect a new mayor. He added that above all, party unity and talent would guide them as they select the committee and they would \""select the best cadres\"". ",hinnews.com,0

"Please Dont believe 99% of the viral xenophobic messages, SAPS warns"," Most of the text messages, videos and pictures circulated to intimidate foreign nationals are fake or old, according to national South African Police Service (SAPS) spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo. \""99% of them are either old or they are fake, or they are not from this country,\"" he told News24.

This has the potential to incite further violence,\"" he said. News24 has seen many threatening messages aimed at foreign nationals in South Africa, as well as violent videos, but the authenticity of these have not been confirmed. One message was purported to have been \""published by News24\"". It claimed that main roads would be blocked in Johannesburg due to protests and quoted a \""spokesperson T Gumbersita\"" who appealed to employers to let their employees leave work early. News24 has never published this ? neither before, nor after it was posted.

Ernst Roets should be jailed for 30 days for being in contempt of court," Representing the Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF), advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi argued in the Equality Court on Wednesday that Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum?s Ernst Roets should be jailed for 30 days for being in contempt of court for tweeting a picture of the old South African flag hours after \""gratuitous\"" displays of it were ruled to be hate speech. According to Ngcukaitobi, a proper reading of the recent ruling shows that Roets was clearly prohibited from displaying the flag. His doing so amounts to a deliberate undermining of the courts for which he should be appropriately punished, Ngcukaitobi further argued. Ngcukaitobi also questioned whether Roets needed to include a picture of the flag in his tweet, which he claimed was an \""academic question\"" and therefore legal according to the new ruling. An urgent application brought by the Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF) seeking to hold Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum in contempt of court over Roets? tweet continues to be heard at the Equality Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday, with advocate Cedric Puckrin acting for AfriForum. Judge Colin Lamont is presiding. Roets tweeted the flag on August 21 along with the question \""Did I just commit hate speech?\"". In another tweet, he argued that his use of the flag was legal as it was for \""academic purposes\"". He is also arguing that he tweeted it in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the organisation. The Equality Act does not protect academic displays of the flag that were made in bad faith, a statement released by the foundation said at the time. On Wednesday morning, Ngcukaitobi argued that anyone who read Roets? tweet would interpret it as being from AfriForum, as it came from one of its leaders only hours after the judgment. He further argued that the August 21 judgment must be enforced strictly, as it was a declaratory order which constituted more than just advice. Ngcukaitobi said the absence of an interdict did not mean that AfriForum had not committed contempt of court. Judge Lamont asked Ngcukaitobi if Roets? actions could be considered contempt of court since the display of the flag was not prohibited but only declared hate speech by the ruling. In response, Ngcukaitobi argued that this interpretation would be too technical and narrow, as Roets? actions deliberately undermined the authority of the judiciary contempt and should therefore legally constitute contempt of court. The application continues to be heard. Judge President Phineas Mojapelo ruled that badly intentioned public displays of the old South African flag, which its detractors often referred to as the \""apartheid flag\"", should be limited, since \""gratuitous display\"" constituted not only hate speech but also harassment, and could be interpreted as an expression of white superiority, divisiveness, and severe racial prejudice. The flag was in use from 1928 to 1994 and was used by the Union of South Africa and its successor state, the Republic of South Africa, until 1994. (Compiled by Daniel Friedman.

eThekwini Leadership crises lingers on.," The political crises in eThekwini municipality has been telling on the leadership council as at least three executive committee (exco) meetings have not been held, while various sub-committees have also not held their meetings in the past month, impacting negatively on service delivery. the community services, municipal public accounts and human settlements committees did not sit, but the security and emergency, governance and economic development committees held their meetings. Mdu Nkosi, IFP councillor said the sub-committees made recommendations and had a \""huge\"" impact in the running of the city. He said \""Line departments communicate with these committees to understand issues on the ground. If these committees don?t sit, the city is not functioning because there will be no recommendations made to the exco and then to the full council for their endorsement.\"" The councillor added that the municipality would have been placed under administration a long time ago if the province was run by opposition parties. A local governance expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Professor Fayth Ruffin said the separation of politics and administration was a long-standing issue worldwide. She said \""It?s called the politics-administration dichotomy. To get past that, the idea is to establish complementarity between politics and administration in a way that an administration and management can continue, irrespective of the political issues.\"" The professor further said studies showed how the complementarity of politics and administration could be ensured by using African knowledge. \""African ways of knowing integrate things for productive outcomes.\"" The municipality?s leadership paralysis resulted after the ANC?s provincial executive demoted all its members who sat in exco, including former mayor Zandile Gumede and her deputy, Fawzia Peer.

A report released by the Stats SA in June 2018 indicated a drastic increase in the murder rate of women, amounting to a 117% increase between the period of 2015 to 2017. The numbers of women who have encountered rape has escalated from 31 665 in 2015 to 70,813 in 2017, which is a 53% increase.\"" \""The numbers have been escalating despite our efforts and that of civil society, political formations and the public at large.

We need to confront violence against women and children with the same viciousness it presents to us. Over the past weeks alone, the country has been mourning deaths of more than 20 woman who have been murdered either by their partners, in their homes and in places that should be a place of refuge for them such as a Post Office. The scourge of violence against women continues to be prevalent in our country and we have all been condemning these acts which undermine women?s rights to live peacefully without fear.\"" The league further said light of this, it would intensify its efforts to find solutions and had \""opened our doors for engagements with all those who respect women?s autonomy.\"" the statement also read that \""Right now, we have just held a consultative engagement with our stakeholders, to discuss the scourge of violence against women and children, to consolidate actions in dealing with this scourge. \""Gender-based violence is a national crisis and [at the] top in the resolutions of the stakeholder meeting we have just convened, is calling for the president to declare a state of emergency, to amend sentencing and prosecution of offenders.

He said \""After careful consideration we agreed that in the best interest of the ANC and the people of the metropolitan of eThekwini, we would agree that the Exco that has been requested to vacate their seats vacate their seats.\"" He however said that the Exco members would remain as councillors in the eThekwini metropolitan. The secretary general said that the national leadership met with Gumded today and she accepted the decision to step down. He said \""We met with comrade Zandile Gumede, who?s a very senior member of the ANC and a very respected member of the ANC; she has accepted the decision made by the national officials and has undertaken to work within the council to assist to unite the council as well as go back on the ground to assist with the unification of the ANC as well.\"" Duarte revealed that there would be no disciplinary action against Gumede for defying an order by the provincial leadership to resign; Gumede initially resigned but later withdrew her resignation. The embattled Gumede would officially leave office on Thursday when the speaker convenes a sitting to elect a new mayor. It is recalled that Gumede threw the party into a crack up last week when she withdrew her resignation, a move which saw the inauguration of Mxolisi Kaunda as the new mayor being suspended. Withdrawing her resignation letter came after Gumede met with ANC national officials to plead for her job back after the provincial executive committee (PEC) recalled her for various reasons, including failure to deliver services. She is also facing corruption charges, but the PEC maintained their decision was not based on this. ",hinnews.com,0

"Our nation is burning and bleeding. Its time to come out of hiding and act, President Ramaphosa"," The following remarks were delivered today by DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane, in Johannesburg. Maimane was joined by representatives from DA-led Gauteng governments, which included Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, Midvaal Mayor, Bongani Baloyi, and Johannesburg MMC for Finance, Funzi Ngobeni (o.b.o Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba). Fellow South Africans We are today a nation in mourning. The news yesterday of the brutal and calculated rape and murder of 19-year-old Uyinene Mrwetyana by a civil servant employed by the state has shocked the collective conscience of our nation. A young girl was subjected to such barbaric and inhumane treatment and had her life cut short while performing a regular errand such as entering a Post Office. Just this past week, 14-year-old Janika Mallo was found dead in her grandmother?s back yard after being raped and murdered. And boxing champion Leighandre \""Baby Lee\"" Jegels, was murdered by her boyfriend ? a SAPS employee entrusted to protect citizens. On behalf of the DA, I extend my most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of these young women whose lives were taken by cruelty and evil beyond comprehension. These young women were not the first victims of the violence against women that is so prevalent in our society. We?ve been exposed to similar tragedies. From Courtney Peters to Karabo Mokoena, from Valencia Farmer to Meghan Cremer. These are daughters of our nation who ought to be protected from harm, not preyed upon. The sad reality is that unless swift action is taken, these young women won?t be the last victims of such crimes. Official statistics tell us that last year alone, almost 40 000 people were raped in South Africa ? the overwhelming majority being women. That?s 109 people raped per day, and those are only the victims who decide to report the crime. We need urgent, clear and decisive action and we cannot wait a moment longer. This goes much further than putting the perpetrators of such heinous acts in jail. It requires addressing the root causes of this social and moral decay and bold leadership making hard, unpopular but effective decisions. I have just moments ago finished a scheduled meeting with the leadership of the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SACCI). Even within the business community, the sentiment is clear: South Africans are scared and lack real hope for the future. Our businesses are shutting down and struggling to create jobs, our young girls are being raped and murdered, and drugs and gangsterism are stealing our young people?s future. South Africans are crying out for leadership in action. We are seeing economic and social collapse in action, and the widespread violent protests, looting, destruction of property and general lawlessness which has taken place over the past weeks and months is evidence of this. This civil unrest reached its peak yesterday where the City of Johannesburg, the City of Tshwane, and large parts of the City of Ekurhuleni were under siege by violent protest action. In this light, we condemn this action in the strongest terms possible and call for the restoration of law and order. Those caught breaking the law must be arrested and prosecuted, and we welcome the arrests already made. But more is required. Therefore, today we call on President Cyril Ramaphosa to come out of hiding and break his silence on the unfolding social and economic crises. Ramaphosa was elected to lead, and each day he remains silent, the situation deteriorates even further. We call on the President to at once: Oversee the accelerated operation of the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS) in every area affected by protests and lawlessness. The NATJOINTS is empowered to coordinate all security and law enforcement operations throughout the country and is best placed to first anticipate and if necessary, to respond timeously to incidents of criminality and disorder when they occur; Instruct the urgent deployment of Public Order Policing to all volatile areas within Gauteng and surrounds; Appear before Parliament to make an urgent statement in the House about what is being done to renew the social contract between the state and citizens given the complete breakdown in trust and social order; Announce an immediate cut to spending on VIP protection for politicians. The VIP protection budget allocation to each individual is approximately R10 million per year, with Ramaphosa?s Cabinet costing R631 million per year in VIP protection. This money must be redirected to capacitating law enforcement agencies to combat and prevent crime; and Establish a special task team to review the systems and processes of law enforcement officials and agencies, the SAPS, and the criminal justice system, with a focus on how to better predict and prevent violent crimes against women. I will also be seeking an urgent update from the Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, on what progress, if any, has been made in implementing the findings of Parliament?s Ad Hoc Joint Committee on Probing Violence against Foreign Nationals. This report was finalised and adopted by Parliament on 18 November 2015 ? almost four years ago. It is common cause that a significant contributor to our social ills is SAs collapsing economy. Protests, violence and looting are often caused and exacerbated by vast inequality, joblessness, and economic exclusion faced by millions across our country. With over 10 million South Africans unemployed, and half the nation living below the poverty line ? we have run out of \""extra time\"". It?s now or never. If we don?t fix our economy we will not fix our broken society. Therefore, it is high time our political differences are put aside as we work together across party lines in order to implement one economic plan that benefits all South Africans. This task begins on Thursday, when Parliament will hold an urgent debate of public importance on South Africa?s jobs crisis following my request. This debate comes at a time when politicians in Parliament need to put the people first and put their words into action. If we don?t deal urgently and decisively with the underlying causes of the upfolding economic and social collapse engulfing our nation, we will have no country left to build. In closing, I would like to call on every church, mosque, synagogue ? all religious leaders and South Africans of faith to continuously pray for our nation and its leadership. I thank you.",hinnews.com,0
DAs John Steenhuisen Still Pushing For The Removal Of Public Protector,"The Democratic Alliance (DA) has today written to the Speaker to submit a set of draft rules to guide the conduct of Parliament when it considers the removal of a Head of a Chapter 9 institution, such as the Public Protector. Last week, the portfolio committee on Justice and Correctional Services met to discuss the DA?s request, dated May 2019, for Parliament to consider the removal of Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, the incumbent Public Protector, from office. The committee resolved to refer the matter back to the Speaker?s office so that the Programming and Rules committee may set down rules to guide the process to be followed by Parliament in this matter. The decision by the committee accords with a legal opinion obtained by the DA that advised this same course of action, in order to ensure legal and procedural certainty to all parties involved and protect the integrity of the process. The DA considers the removal of Advocate Mkhwebane to be a matter of great urgency. We opposed her appointment from the start, and she has since then demonstrated that she is not a fit and proper person to occupy the office of Public Protector. She has consistently shown herself to be unable to act independently, and her often blatantly unlawful actions has caused great damage not only to the reputation of her office but also to the economic well-being of South Africa and the position of the rule of law in this country. The DA however also believes that due process should be followed in order to effect Advocate Mkhwebane?s removal. It is to marry the need for urgency with the need for proper rules and procedures to be put in place first that the DA has taken it upon ourselves to submit a set of draft rules to the Speaker, in order to hopefully assist the Programming and Rules committee in the task that lies before it. The DA believes that South Africans deserve a Public Protector that truly protects the rights and the interests of the public against abuses by the state, and we will not rest in our efforts to ensure that Advocate Mkhwebane is removed and a fit and proper successor installed in her place.",hinnews.com,0

POLICE MINISTER Bheki Cele MOVES TO REDUCE ILLEGAL FIRE ARMS IN THE NATION,"In a bid to reduce the number of illegal fire arms and ammunition in the country, the minister of police Bheki Cele has asked the parliament again to approve another deceleration of the firearm amnesty, to run for six months from next month. The police minister wrote to National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise, requesting that the police portfolio committee consider the amended draft declaration for the firearm amnesty. The speaker has however referred the letter to committee because the Firearms Control Act provides for the amnesty to be valid if it is approved by Parliament. In the letter the minister drafted, he noted that a draft notice for a declaration of amnesty was tabled by his predecessor Fikile Mbalula in 2017 and was referred to the police portfolio committee. He also said the committee had required that Mbalula table a new letter containing the new date prior to approval. Cele revealed that the proposed new dates for amnesty would be October this year to March next year. Some of the information in the drafted letter include \""The portfolio committee was unable to consider the draft notice prior to February 1, 2018, being the proposed date on which the amnesty period was set to commence. While I am in support of the declaration of an amnesty on the condition that was in principle already agreed to by the portfolio committee, I further wish to add that an application contemplated in Section 134 (4) of the said Act shall not apply to illegal firearms where documentary proof of previous ownership cannot be produced. \""It will be appreciated if the amended draft notice can be forwarded to the portfolio committee of police for consideration. Cele revealed that the Firearm Control Act required him to publish a notice to declare an amnesty; he said \""The amnesty may result in the reduction of the number of illegally possessed firearms in South Africa. It?s in the public interest to do so.\"" In terms of legislation, the amnesty must specify the period in which people may apply for it as well as the conditions under which it may be granted. The amnesty was first mooted by former minister Nathi Nhleko in 2017, but parliamentary processes were not concluded at the time. It was resuscitated by his successor, Mbalula, and then once again by Cele last year. There were delays in processing the amnesty amid a Constitutional Court judgment, which ruled that it was an offence to possess a firearm without a licence; this had sparked confusion over whether the thousands of people with expired licences could not be criminally prosecuted when handing over their firearms",hinnews.com,0

"RIGHT2KNOW BLAMES GOVERNMENT, COMMUNITY LEADERS FOR XENOPHOBIC ATTACKS"," The government has been blamed for the recent attacks on foreigners by the Right2Know Campaign. In a statement released on Monday amid the continued looting and burning of foreign-owned shops in Gauteng, the organisation blamed Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and president Cyril Ramaphosa. The organisation said the attacks on non-South Africans can be directly linked to calls by politicians to ?defend the sovereignty of the state? and confirms a dangerous emerging trend of \""xenophobic populism\"" which leads to attacks on foreign nationals. The statement reads: \""We recognise that there are many sources of the violence but it is also clear that statements of outrage and condemnation by state officials at all levels (Cabinet, Parliament, the Gauteng Province, SAPS and Metros) fuelled the actions of ordinary citizens who interpreted those statements to be licence to take the law into their own hands. \""Senior political leaders find an easy target in the vulnerable Africans seeking to make a new home in South Africa. \""Indeed, there is a dangerous emerging trend of xenophobic populism that leads to attacks on foreign nationals. In 2015, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini?s speech, President Cyril Ramaphosa?s 2019 election campaign pronouncements, the Minister of Health?s comments on the strain placed on health services by foreign migrants, and the xenophobic blaming for Johannesburg?s ill by Mayor Herman Mashaba have been followed by xenophobic attacks in different localities. \""In all these instances, even when not responding to a direct call, political populism is used as justification by instigators and perpetrators who would have been waiting for an opportunity to strike for their own reasons. Right2Know slammed the attacks, saying they were hate crimes. They said the assaults and the looting of the foreigners? property just because they were not born in South Africa could never be justified. The organization also said in its statement that \""These actions which are criminal in nature, when combined with the targeting of the victims as belonging to a certain group, becomes a hate crime. \""Apartheid was the experience of being stateless and homeless within one?s home country. Today, we find South Africans showing the same hatred towards fellow Africans that we ourselves suffered not too long ago. \""As hosts of the World Conference Against Racism in 2001, we recognised xenophobia (and the local Afrophobia) as expressions of racism; in 2008 we experienced how the deep roots of internalised oppression enabled us to turn our own experience of racism and oppression into actions that discriminated against, targeted and in some cases killed other Africans living in South Africa. \""It is an issue of national shame that xenophobic violence has become a regular and highly visible feature of South Africa?s political landscape. Outsiders have been regularly attacked, killed and their livelihoods destroyed since the dawn of democracy in 1994. \""Community and local leaders also incite violence against migrants by blaming local economic conditions on the presence of migrants. \""Research evidence further demonstrates that interventions to address xenophobia in the country have failed largely because of the state?s denialism (\""it is just crime and not xenophobia\""); lack of political will and impunity, all of which encourage perpetrators to strike whenever it suits their interests.\"" Chaos erupted over the weekend after residents went on a rampage following a blaze at a building that claimed three lives in Jeppestown. Foreign-owned shops were looted, car dealerships were torched and a metro police officer was injured during the chaos. As at Monday evening, 91 people had been arrested and many foreign-owned shops remained closed as owners were scared of being attacked. Many others stood empty after being looted and burnt.",hinnews.com,0

During his testimony, he referred to judgments in which Jiba and Mrwebi were criticised for their conduct in the decision to withdraw charges against former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli. Nxasana revealed that on July 18, 2014, he made recommendations to the Minister of Justice to ask the president to institute disciplinary action against Jiba and Mrwerbi and to place them on suspension pending the hearing. He also told the commission about a \""fact-finding commission\"", which retired Constitutional Court Justice Zak Yacoob chaired; he gave instructions to everyone to co-operate with the commission, however, Jiba and Mrwebi failed to do so. In his words \""The situation is that he Zuma acted against me instead of acting against them.

Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane gets support in form of prayer and donation," Embattled public protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane is definately not alone in her battles as about R130,000 has been raised as part of a crowdfunding kitty to help her fulfil her obligation to pay the R900 000 that she is personally liable for. This is coming after a Constitutional Court ruling, which confirmed an earlier Pretoria High Court ruling that set aside Mkhwebane?s 2017 Absa-Bankorp report and ordered her to pay 15% of the legal costs. The chairperson of civil society organisation Democracy in Action, Thabo Mtshweni who spearheaded the crowdfunding campaign announced on Friday the amount that has been generated so far; he did so during a prayer service for Mkhwebane organised by the Victory Fellowship Church in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. Those who attended the prayer service were Mkhwebane?s family, her colleagues traditional leaders, civic organisations and political parties such as the African Transformation Movement (ATM), the African People?s Convention (APC) and ANC Women?s League president Bathabile Dlamini. Her deputy Kevin Malunga was however not present. Participants in the prayer meeting portrayed Mkhwebane as a victim and decried the punitive costs order. The entire session focused on the judiciary, Parliament and the executive. Participants also made donations, but the amount was undisclosed. During the prayer session, Mkhwebane told the prayer gathering that she was wrongfully perceived as a politician and being part of a faction. Mkhwebane in her speech peppered with biblical verses said \""The Reserve Bank is highly politicised, You do not touch the banks worldwide, \""Everything we do is according to the law ? Even if they remove me, I will always fight for the truth. Backward never.\"" She revealed that her mother did not want her to take the job after seeing how her predecessor, Thuli Madonsela, was treated.

They will have to produce their evidence in court,\"" she added that only her family and her teenage daughter needed prayers because \""Busisiwe has peace that surpasses understanding.\"" Thabo Mtshweni warned that when Parliament started the process to remove Mkhwebane, his organisation would lobby citizens to boycott paying their taxes. He said \""Our government is focusing on a well-functioning office of the Public Protector while we have problems such as nyaope and unemployment. When they start the process to remove you, we will ask citizens not to pay taxes.\"" Bathabile Dlamini, the ANC?s women league leader said the ANC Women?s League would support Mkhwebane. She called on the judiciary, Parliament and the executive to respect chapter 9 institutions. In her words \""We would not want to hear that the Public Protector died peacefully in her sleep, died in a car crash or ate poisoned food. I have experienced what is happening to you ? to be forced to pay from your pocket for doing government?s job. They stop your pension because they want to flatten you.\"" Themba Godi, the president of APC said hat only African people were being policed and called to account since 1994, adding: \""Judges are not God, they are human beings. They have friends, they read newspapers and they must be held accountable.\"" Vuyo Zungula, the ATM?s president \""It must be the people who say they don?t want the Public Protector. Everywhere you go, people are appreciating her work, but power is not with the people. Power is in the money.\"" The prayer meeting followed a decision by the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services on Tuesday to refer the question of an inquiry into Mkhwebane?s suitability as Public Protector to the rules committee. This committee will be asked to draft rules that will serve as a guideline for the removal of any head of a chapter 9 institution. Last year, the Pretoria High Court hit Mkhwebane with a punitive costs order pertaining to her Absa-Bankorp report, setting aside her finding that Absa should repay R1.1 billion to the Reserve Bank. Mkhwebane challenged this order in the Constitutional Court, but the court upheld the previous finding that her investigation was flawed and that she had acted in bad faith.",hinnews.com,0

According to church founder Pope Tsietsi Makiti, it was their fifth funeral in which they were asked by the families to bury their dead for them. He also added that they had already married two couples who are still happily married. He said they do all these at no cost because they are a church for the people. In most cases churches charge people so that they can bury for them, how do you charge a grieving, poor, hurting family? This is not a church of booze and taverns only because we care about our people and families, said Church leader Pope Tsietsi Makiti. -Dailysun ",mzanzi stories,0

Gauteng resident blacklisted for not paying E-toll,"Gauteng resident blacklisted for not paying E-toll A Gauteng motorists surprise discovery has revealed the South African National Road Agencys (Sanral) latest ploy to recoup billions of rand owed in e-tolls. The motorist, according to Rudie Heyneke, Organisation Outdoing Tax Abuse (Outa) transport portfolio manager, was applying for credit when it was discovered they had been blacklisted for owing R60 000 in e-toll fees. Sanral had obtained a default judgment against this motorist, who allegedly had received a summons. At least 25 other e-toll defaulters have also been given default judgments, but Heyneke believes this figure is probably a lot higher. Legally, they have the right to do this. The problem that we have is that it is not ethical, as we are in the advanced stages of a test case that is testing the lawfulness of the e-toll scheme, said Heyneke. Default judgments are obtained when the debtor does not respond or defend a summons. The problem, Heyneke points out, is that debtor details are obtained from the e-Natis system, which in the past has been found to be a unreliable source of data. Summons are often sent to wrong addresses, and debtors, says Heyneke, are unaware that they have been served with the legal document. There have also been problems in the past where vehicles that are in other motorists names or where registration plates have been cloned. The state is under no obligation to inform motorists if a default judgment has been made, said Heyneke. Many defaulters will only discover they had a default judgment against them when they apply for credit. This might be when they attempt to take out a home loan. Heyneke said this could have a disastrous impact on households. Only one in three motorists is believed to be paying their e-toll bill, but Heyneke believes this figure is not accurate and that the figure of non-compliance is far higher. Many e-toll defaulters simply throw away their bills, but Outa has warned that motorists should not ignore summonses. The civil rights organisation said that if motorists are issued a summons over unpaid bills they must act quickly. It suggested motorists contact its offices for guidance. Outa also suggests that motorists should regularly check their credit ratings. Sanral was unavailable for comment at the time of going to press. The motorist who had the default judgment served against, is taking legal action to rescind the judgment. Heyneke believes if Sanral goes ahead with a mass blitz of using summons and issuing default judgments to collect on their debts, it could have a detrimental effect on the economy of Gauteng. Three million people use those highways, of that, lets say two million are not paying and are issued summons. And lets say that 30% of them dont contest this and are issued default judgments. That is 600000 people with no more credit. It would have a huge impact on the economy. Sanral hasnt thought this through.",mzanzi stories,0

WATCH VIDEO : Conor McGregor attacking UFC bus at New York event,"WATCH VIDEO : Conor McGregor attacking UFC bus at New York event New York - Conor McGregor turned himself in to US police on Thursday night following an incident where he allegedly attacked a shuttle bus loaded with fellow mixed martial arts fighters who were attending a New York media event. The 29-year-old McGregor surrendered to the 78th Precinct station but there was no immediate indication whether charges had been filed, the New York Post reported. The newspaper said McGregor was being questioned and would eventually be charged with criminal mischief and reckless endangerment. Video of the earlier incident (WATCH in the tweets below) clearly showed McGregor hurling a dolly through a side window of the bus as it moved slowly in a car park at the Barclays Centre in New York. Conor McGregor and his crew go BERSERK in crazy bus attack! #TMZ #TMZSports pic.twitter.com/FGsTA4f0Ql  TMZ (@TMZ) April 5, 2018 UFC President Dana White said fighter Michael Chiesa, who was on the bus, had been hospitalised following the incident and was being treated for cuts to the face. Police had issued a warrant for the arrest of McGregor, White added, accusing the Irish superstar and a group of around 20 men of \""storming the building.\"" \""They got down to the loading docks where the fighters were getting on the buses and attacked them, throwing trash cans, dollies, things like that,\"" White said. \""Broke one of the windows, cut Michael Chiesa real bad, cut his hand, cut his face. \""Everyone's shaken up.

His plane cannot take off, he can't leave the state of New York.\"" White predicted McGregor, who reportedly pocketed around $100 million for his superfight against boxer Floyd Mayweather last August, would likely face legal action over the incident. \""As you can imagine he's going to be sued beyond belief,\"" White said. \""This was a real bad career move for him.\"" It was not clear what triggered McGregor's assault but it appeared to be linked in part to the UFC's decision to strip him of his world title. McGregor reportedly turned up unannounced at the end of Thursday's press event to publicise the upcoming UFC 223 card. On Wednesday, White said the UFC would strip McGregor of his lightweight title, which would be awarded to the winner of Saturday's fight between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Max Holloway in New York.

Opportunitiess and Options You Have After Matric (grade 12) or High School," Opportunitiess and Options You Have After Matric (grade 12) or High School College is not for everyone, but knowledge is critical. There are numerous careers that do not require a four-year degree. The important thing is to get out there and do stuff. Instead of waiting to be taught, go out and learn. Here is a list of other things you can do after your high school let down; 1. Work Go out and see what the working world is really like. Take a year to work full-time and earn real money. By working full-time at a fast food joint, or as a waiter, or doing landscaping, youll learn invaluable life lessons. Youll learn about customer service, about bucking up and working even when you dont want to, about budgeting your income, about balancing life and work. Join the Military While not always a popular  or safe choice  joining the military is often a great way to learn more about yourself. Joining the military offers you a chance to serve your country, make a career in the service, and/or earn money toward a future college education. Youll also earn valuable work experience that can you can apply to civilian jobs once you get discharged. Volunteer These days volunteering is something for people to put on a college application or a resume; its always a means, never an end. So maybe spend a year volunteering out of high school, youll probably become a much better, more understanding person for it. Travel Traveling allows you to experience the world. You could fall in love with another culture and decide you want to move there. If all you can think about is getting out of your town and exploring some other part of the world, then traveling may be for you. If you dont have the money, look into student exchange programs like AIESEC, employment on cruise ships, or becoming an au pair or nanny for a family in another country. Try the arts If art is your passion you should strongly consider not attending a 4-year college. Getting an associates degree as a backup plan is a good idea, but then just put everything you have into your craft through deliberate practice, and consider moving to an art-friendly city, or one of these other top cities for artists, where you can find peers and mentors that can help critique and improve your work. Learn a trade Even if you dont pursue your chosen trade later in life, knowledge accrued during a year of learning massage therapy at a beauty school tricks or some book keeping skills will always be helpful and can save you quite a bit of money in the long run. Start A Business Some of the most successful men of the 20th and 21st centuries were entrepreneurs without a college degree. All you need is the passion, the drive, and confidence to make it all happen. While its certainly true that more small businesses fail than succeed, youd be hard-pressed to find an entrepreneur who didnt learn invaluable lessons even amidst their failures. Learn How To Play An Instrument Music can be very healthy for your emotional life. In a recent research where people where asked how they think playing their instrument plays a part in how they feel. Many people believe that playing their instrument provides an outlet to express their feelings, and some see it as a way to let loose their creative impulses. Join A Sport Sports are good for learning accountability, dedication, and leadership, among many other traits. Putting it all together by playing a sport is a winning combination. Watching your hard work pay off and achieving your dreams brings about tons of self-confidence. Also, sports will improve your fitness and weight goals. However, they also encourage healthy decisions such as not smoking or drinking and offer hidden health benefits.",mzanzi stories,0

NEW CONDOMS THAT CHANGE COLOUR WHEN EXPOSED TO STDs!,"NEW CONDOMS THAT CHANGE COLOUR WHEN EXPOSED TO STDs! In 2015 an eye-catching story about the award-winning creative idea of three teens in England: condoms that change color when they detect a sexually transmitted infection. Time reported that three British teens, two 14-year-olds and one 13-year-oldhave proposed an idea for a new type of condom that could detect sexually transmitted diseases amongst intimate partners. The proposal won the trio the top prize in the U.K.s TeenTech Awards, and they have already reportedly been approached by condom companies. Young people who do not like using condoms during sexual intercourse in are the main cause behind high rate of unwanted babies and the spread of sexual transmitted infections such as HIV. This new condom could potentially reduce the amount of people getting sexually transmitted infections!

James Nee, who was in the company of Beston Khamba and Brian Gondwe had a car crush on Tuesday,October 2, 2018 in South Africa on their way from Malawi where the Prophet was having a crusade. Despite all that, fake reports published that people were shocked during body viewing which never took place, the picture was taken in the mortuary by one of the undertakers, if you have a logic mind you would know that every casket has a Glass covering the corpse, in the picture that is making rounds on social media there is no Glass which proves that the picture was taken during preparation of the corpse. SEE UNCOVERED PICTURE H-E-R-E If you understand the prophetic James Nee released a single and made posts on social media which predicted his death, it was prophetic and the Prophet knew about the death because God had prepared him. Prophet Bushiri is the most h_ated prophet all over the world, so the picture was taken to shame him. During the funeral Marry Bushiri was present and Bushiri arrived late after the funeral because of the crusade he had in Uganda.

Best Tips to Attract Rich Men and Keep Them Interested for ever.,"How i attracted my rich men and kept him interested. To attract rich men and hold their attention a woman should be all she can be as far as beauty goes. Looking well kept and fresh will go a long way if you are not a natural beauty, as most rich men like a woman who is neat and trim. Never let him see you in over sized sweatshirts and baggy pants. Take care to be your ultimate well-groomed and polished self when on the hunt for a wealthy man. Your look should be pretty, feminine and conservative. Avoid going for the bimbo look, with mini skirts, and spiked heels because most men will find it impossible to respect you and consider taking you seriously. Remember men tend to categorize women; and the categories are often: respectable, trustworthy and sweet, or, loose, shallow, and temporary. These very basic views can linger in a mans mind for a year or even a lifetime, so it is important to make some solid first impressions. If you have tattoos, you should hide them as much as possible, as most rich men generally like a clean and sophisticated lady, not a biker chic. If you are truly serious about being with a rich man you should place yourself around rich men every day. The more rich men you spend time around the more dates you will get the the more options you will have. Gear your life in a way that keeps you in the circles of the wealthiest men, and keep building upon your group. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, there are a lot of rich men out there and make sure you get the chance to be seen around as many as possible. Once you have landed a few first dates you must follow the guidelines of how to win a rich man by avoiding these common mistakes. This is the time to intrigue and lure a man into your life. After dating one or two men seriously for about one year it is time to get married. You don't exactly have to be walking down the isle after knowing a man for only one year but you should feel very secure with the idea that he wants a future with you. If you don't feel secure about he being serious with you, its time to place him on the back burner and focus on another man. The reason for this is that it only takes about one year for a man to make a decision about you, and too many women let themselves become used for years on end while the guy strings her along. Men don't let themselves get jerked around in the same manner and will usually strike at their goals, succeed or fail, and then move on, but women will stew and be tormented until their self esteem is shattered. Don't let this happen to you! The cure for one man is another. Source: pairedlife",mzanzi stories,0

SA student bust with R9m cash at OR Tambo escapes jail time,"SA student bust with R9m cash at OR Tambo escapes jail time The case of 23-year-old student Fayrooz Saleh  who was caught with US dollars worth over R9m, which she failed to declare at the OR Tambo International Airport  was concluded in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court last week. In a written plea agreement, the student, who was arrested on September 11 2018 on her way to Hong Kong, shed light on where she had obtained the cash. The accused had travelled to Hong Kong after a long-time friend of hers, Mr Faisal Jamal, had asked that she should assist him to purchase goods, the plea agreement read. The goods she was to buy were listed as PlayStations, game consoles, iPhones, laptops, iPads, notebooks, desktops, cellphones, jewellery, clothes and accessories. [Jamal] paid for her return ticket and said everything will be taken care of, including accommodation and food upon her arrival, the agreement read. The accused was only advised after her arrest and release from custody by Mr Jamal that the money that was in her possession belonged to a businessman called Mr Ravichandren Dhurgasamy. Shortly after Salehs arrest, Sars said she initially denied having the $630,700 with her, but this was uncovered when her luggage was searched. This led to the state arguing that Saleh had intentionally failed to declare the large sum of money that she had in her possession. Both the state and Salehs lawyer reached an agreement on her sentence, which saw Saleh escape jail time. The agreement read: The accused is sentenced to a fine of R200,000 or 24 months imprisonment. It is ordered  that the whole of this sentence be suspended for a period of three years, on condition that the accused is not convicted in contravention of section 15(1) of the Customs and Excise Act 91 of 1964 or an offence of which dishonesty is an element and for which imprisonment without the option of a fine is imposed during the period of suspension.",mzanzi stories,0

Mzansi's women hit world record of buying sex toys,"Mzansi's women hit world record of buying sex toys Mzansis women have been singled out among the people with the highest appetite for se_ toys in the world according to a research conducted by the Statistic Brain Research Institute. The research has revealed an unbelieving increase in the curiosity of South Africans, mainly women about se_x toys saying the country came third globally for the highest number of Google searches for se_x toys, trailing the US and the UK. Addressing why this is so, se_xologists and se_x shop owners say female empowerment in the bedroom and the availability of high-quality se_x toys could be some of the attributing factors According to Adult World chief executive Arthur Kalamaris, the open-mindedness of the female population has led to the increased purchase of the toy. The whole marketplace is changing, with 55 percent of our se_x toy sales to women. It used to be male-dominated, like the man would go into the store and pick out a se_x toy, but thats completely shifted, he said. Dealers in se_x toys in the country revealed further that women were becoming more open and comfortable with introducing toys into their se_x lives, taking charge of their own pleasure. se_x should be fun. Lots of people dont know that. Some women still see it as an obligation and thats not how it should be, said Sari Cohen, owner of Cape Towns Allure Sensuality Emporium. S Customers of all ages and races were said to be patronizing the product and shop owner Cohen said she offers a senior discount and frequently attends events and parties to educate curious potential buyers. Cohen also revealed that her stockroom is filled with high-quality products that range in price from R350 to more than R3 000. I love se_x toys so much because they help women learn about themselves and their bodies, If they are used with consent and women are opening their minds to the possibility of pleasure, thats really empowering and important. It means that they are ready to love themselves and embrace themselves, she said Speaking about the research result, Brodie Meyer, the managing director of Desir Intimate Collection, another Cape Town se_x shop said he is happy with the increasing sale adding that south Africa is now traditionally accepting and associating with se_x shops. I was happy to see the study because it reiterates the need for se_x toys, managing director Brodie Meyer said. What were seeing is normalization and the creation of dialogue, along with more awareness of the adult toy industry. Meyer also pointed out that with the emergence of e-marketing, shopping for se_x toys can be private and one can do it with a partner at home, she said. However, report from the shop owner also has it that most of the women who buy the toy do hide it from their partner. It makes me sad to see them do that, but at the same time Id rather they take control of their own pleasure rather than not at all if theyre not satisfied, Cohen said On this, a local |se_xologist Dr Marlene Wasserman said se_x toys is very helpful to the se_xual health of a relationship because it builds an active communications in partners. Avoiding se_xuality is unhealthy and se_x toys are a great way to explore that and have conversations about it, he added. Source:BuzzSouthAfrica",mzanzi stories,0

Watch Video: Pastor Alph Lukau raises dead man during church service.,"Watch Video: Pastor Alph Lukau raises dead man during church service. While Prophet Bushiri has walked on air, called fire from heaven and healed diseases, Lukau claims to have brought a man (who seemed to be breathing a lot for a dead guy) back from the dead. Pastor Alph Lukau of Alleluia Ministries International appears to have shaken the country after holding a miracle service at his church on Sunday that, among other extraordinary things, saw people throwing away their wheelchairs after receiving their alleged healing. During the service, the high-flying minister known for his lavish lifestyle, encouraged congregants to keep praying for their miracles. Keep on receiving, you are going home with your miracle, he kept telling congregants as he prayed in tongues. A woman then shouted: Pastor Alph, something is happening outside. There is a family that is about to bring a corpse to Zimbabwe, but they are saying something is happening, man of God. As the funeral parlour drove over the church door, their neighbour said it seemed like the fingers of this dead corpse were beginning to move, she added. The pastor went outside, then asked the workers to take the coffin out of the hearse. He asked the workers to open the coffin. He spoke to the deceaseds older brother before the coffin was completely taken out of the hearse. According to the deceaseds landlord, the man had gotten sick and started coughing a lot on Friday. We took him to the hospital and they said they could not help him because he did not have papers, so we took him to the doctor and he died there, she claimed. The family then took the body to the mortuary, where it was kept until Sunday. Pastor Alph then asked the congregants to lift their hands and start praying. Rise up! he shouted, before the man got up and sat in the coffin, looking confused, like a modern-day Lazarus. The coffin is empty, he said as the congregants jumped and screamed for joy. Lukaus church boasts hundreds of thousands of members across many branches in several countries. He and his wife are known for their conspicuous consumption, including sharing photos of him disembarking from a private jet and various luxury vehicles. Watch the video below:",mzanzi stories,0

NIGERIAN GIRL 'UCHE' DIES AFTER S_LEEPING WITH A DOG  SEE HOW AND WHY SHE SLEPT WITH A DOG,"NIGERIAN GIRL UCHE DIES AFTER S_LEEPING WITH A DOG  SEE HOW AND WHY SHE SLEPT WITH A DOG Uche(her surname withheld) was an Accountancy part time student at Federal University before her death recently. She was one of the happening girls in town, although she liked doing her things in her own little way. In fact, a lot of her course mates didnt know much about her because she was quiet and she didnt talk to anyone in her class. She was from Imo State, her father passed away while her mother is a petty trader in the village. According to reports, Uche was from a poor back ground, she struggled to make ends meet and couldnt send her siblings to school. Uche stayed with her friend in a duplex around Wuse 2, and she drove a Honda car, before she met a guy who changed her life completely, but the guy eventually used her for rituals. One of Uches friends revealed to us how she confessed to her before she died. According to reports Uche met an American based guy named Roland at a restaurant in Abuja. Roland spoilt her with money and gifts, he even bought for her, an exotic car and promised to marry her. She was very happy that she had finally met the man of her dreams. Few weeks after Uche met Roland, she started spending almost every day with him. WATCH IT H-E-R-E Roland spent 6 weeks in Nigeria before going back to the United States, he even gave Uche an engagement ring that she used to flaunt before her friends. Uche kept most of the things she shared with Roland to herself until she fell ill and went to about 3 hospitals, where she was told there was nothing wrong with her. One of her friends who stayed with her, later took her to a white garment church in Kubwa, a suburb in Abuja. The Prophet at the church saw a vision about Uches predicament and advised Uche to confess what has happened to her or else she will die, initially she didnt want to talk but after much persuasion from her friends, she did. She said, Roland liked adventure, so he suggested they should do some nasty things. She said Roland had a dog he cherished, and he suggested she sleeps with the dog while he watched her, she said she didnt want to do it, but later she had s3x with the dog, her friend further revealed that, Uche was angry after the s3x with dog show, but Roland begged her and gave her a car key(Infinity Jeep), assuring her nothing will happen to her. Roland left the country the following day, and promised to start processing her papers to come to the United States once he gets back to U.S. Uches friend and the prophet called the guy but the number didnt exist. They also asked her for the address of Rolands house in Abuja but they didnt get the address she described. The Prophet advised she should be taken back home while she begs God to save her, because she has been used for rituals. Uche died few days later. ",mzanzi stories,0

5 Signs A Woman Is HIV Positive Even Though She Looks Healthy,"5 Signs A Woman Is HIV Positive Even Though She Looks Healthy Women may wonder how HIV symptoms for them differ from those seen in men. Many HIV symptoms are the same for men and women, but not all. Heres a list of 5 common symptoms, including those that are specific to women. Women with HIV can experience changes to their menstrual cycle. Their periods may be lighter or heavier than normal, or they may not have a period at all. HIV-positive women may also have more severe premenstrual symptoms. Most people with HIV develop skin problems. Rash is a common symptom of HIV, and many different types of skin rashes are associated with the condition. They may be a symptom of HIV itself or the result of a concurrent infection or condition. If a rash appears, its a good idea to have a healthcare provider review ones medical history. They can use a complete medical history to determine which diagnostic tests are needed. Lymph nodes are located throughout the human body, including the neck, back of the head, armpits, and groin. As part of the immune system, lymph nodes fend off infections by storing immune cells and filtering pathogens. As HIV begins to spread, the immune system kicks into high gear. The result is enlarged lymph nodes, commonly known as swollen glands. Its often one of the first signs of HIV. In people living with HIV, swollen glands may last for several months.",mzanzi stories,0

8 Things You Should NEVER Tell Your Man,"8 Things You Should NEVER Tell Your Man Ive made a list of things you should never, under any circumstance, tell your man if you want the relationship to survive. Were not saying keep things from each other but some things are better left unsaid. 1. Never admit that you hate his mothereven if he badmouths her first (the Silence Is Golden rule) It can be tempting to add your two cents as your husband is telling you yet another story about his controlling, manipulative, buttinsky mother. Tempting to say, You think thats bad? The other day she told me all of our sons good qualities come from her! Shes just a delusional, dried-up old cow who wishes she could be married to you and who resents the hell out of me just because you love me! Take a deep breath and hold your tongue. Remember, he can say whatever he wants, because shes his mommy. If you agree too adamantly, bad things will happen to your relationship, not the least of which is that your husband will never let you forget your slip up and will preface everything he says about her with that. 2. Never tell him that his best friend made a pass at you(the No Harm, No Foul rule) Unless he is a repeated offender never do this. This will result in a massive fight between the two men and also your husband might start being suspicious of you. Some men might go as far as suspecting that you encouraged their friends to make a pass at you. It might end up sounding like you had an affair. 3. Never confess to past infidelities(the Dont Tell, Dont Tell rule) Now, girls, Id hope this goes without saying, but Ill mention it anyway. I dont care if you were 20 and dru_nk at the time; never admit that you cheated while in a committed relationship. On the subject of fidelity, you are above reproach. And not being a cheater yourself, you have zero tolerance for cheaters. But in all seriousness, you have to ask yourself how the relationship could possibly benefit from your true confessions, and I think youll see the answer is not at all. Doubt can do serious damage. 4. Dont tell him that one of your girlfriends is cheating on her husband(the Keep Your Big Fat Mouth Shut rule) Just keeping your own past slipups under wraps is not enough. In general, you must act as though infidelity is equal to murder. You know it exists, youve read about it in the papers, but you certainly dont know anyone who has actually committed it. (This wont always be easy) 5. Dont say hes not as hard as he used to be(the Its Your Memory Thats Getting Soft rule) So your husband doesnt have the tumescence of a 20-year-old frat boy. I bet you dont have the stamina of Venus Williams. I say this not to make you feel bad about your own aging body but to help you appreciate (or at least accept) his. 6. Never tell him that it does bother you that you make more money than he does(the Being Married to You Is a Full-Time Job rule) Really ladies, some things are better kept quiet. Is it necessary? Marriage is collective, everyone brings something to the table whether emotionally, physically or financially. Source: Online ",mzanzi stories,0

Mourners for hire to cry & mourn at funeral - Fake crier for hire,"Hired to mourn and cry at funerals and for reasonable price. Durban - Its important to grieve and show your support for family and friends. Because Everyone who was there when life was great might disappeared when life becomes rough. It is a known fact that when days are dark friends are few so,hire mourners to make the funeral interesting with a lot of mourners crying and rolling around. Dumisane Ngobene, 21, placed an ad on Facebook some time back offering to fake-cry or even cry and roll on the ground at funerals  for a fee. His post, along with a generic picture of people mourning at a funeral, read: Do you want to boost your funeral? We hire out professional mourners to cry at the funeral. The prices are: normal crying at R200 per mourner, crying and rolling on the ground at R300 per mourner, crying and insulting at R400 a mourner, or crying and threatening to jump into the grave at R500 per mourner. Asked if it was disrespectful, Ngobene said no. Funerals are not as sacred as they used to be. Nowadays, people need these services. I discovered that mourning services were a real thing in London and other parts of the world. This got me thinking.",mzanzi stories,0
Reasons Why Women Cry or Moan During Sex,"Reasons Why Women Cry or Moan During Sex Yes, yes, YES! Im coming, Im coming, Im  crying? It is common for women to cry during sex but the big question is why? In most cases, people associate crying with sadness or pain however during sex, crying can be a totally different emotion. Women cry during sex because it is a way of showing appreciation of the moment. Some people cry when they are happy and these tears are called tears of joy, this feeling is the same feeling women have during sex. There are other several reasons women cry during sex , here are a few: She is in pain. A number of women have admitted to feeling pain during sex but not being able to open up to their partner and letting them know that they are hurting them. Some women feel that by letting their partner know that they are in pain, they will hurt their feelings Her emotions are all over the place. It is a known fact that besides sex being physical, it also triggers a lot of emotions. Imagine having sex and you are going through some emotionally stressing situations that you cannot even block out during sex? The tears will definitely flow. She has had a bad experience before. If a woman has had a bad experience with sex in the past, having sex can trigger those emotions while having sex. You feel super-connected Sometimes, there are no words for how deeply connected you feel to your partner. Instead, there are tears, Dr Nasserzadeh says. If sex is a way of deep connection with a partner, your body might choose this form of release to communicate your emotions, she says. Thats pretty typical, Wright adds, since sex releases oxytocin, and oxytocin promotes bonding, trust, and empathy. Its easy to feel safe to release emotions that may have been bottled up for whatever reason, she says. Youre grieving Did a relative or pet die recently? Or perhaps you got laid off or, heck, youre still not over your last breakup. Grief can strike anywhere  walking down the sidewalk, in the middle of work meeting, or, yep, mid-romp. It hurts so good Tears can also strike due to the type of pain you asked for in the form of (consensual) choking, spanking, slapping or getting tied up. Both physical pain and pleasure activate the same part of the brain, Wright says, so its totally possible to be crying from pain and be enjoying it at the same time. Youre ashamed or feeling guilty Dr Nasserzadeh has worked with women who tell her theyve cried during sex because they dont feel like they deserve to take a moment to enjoy themselves. They feel like, as a mother, they should be focusing on their child and not on self-pleasuring, she says. PSA though: You cannot take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself. If youre feeling shame around sex or intimacy in general, and it comes out in the form of tears, its a good indicator to explore that shame outside of the bedroom and see what its about, Wright adds. Youre so happy! Maybe youve had a seriously long dry spell, or maybe sex just has never been that fun or enjoyable to you. If youve never had (or rarely had) satisfying sexual interactions, it might be so wonderful that tears would be a sign of gratitude, joy or happiness, Dr Nasserzadeh says. Let em flow, let em flow, let em flow! Youre triggered Maybe youre a survivor of sexual assault, or maybe something a little off happened once that you thought youd forgotten. Cue sex to remind you. Trauma gets so deeply embedded in our minds and memory that its hard to remember exactly what happened and something [sex] will bring it up, McGuire says. Stop having sex if you feel like your brain and body are dissociating, if painful memories are coming up, or you feel out of control, Wright advises. Crying during sex can be embarrassing for some women but there are ways one can try to overcome this feeling. Try controlling your breathing during sex. Controlling your breathing can help you relax and therefore help you enjoy the process. Breathing exercises can also help by letting the mind relax and making it easier for the body to take charge of the sensation.",mzanzi stories,0

When I laid eyes on him, I realised the trip was worth it, she said. I found myself very comfortable around him and I loved the way he presented himself.

Its not very clear why this happens, but scientists tend to associate this with the antioxidants contained in the drink. Besides, coffee reduces the number of snacks you have during the day and improves the effect of exercises. The habit of drinking coffee successfully replaces the habit of smoking, and its much healthier, and this also affects life expectancy. 5) Coffee makes you smarter Coffee not only energizes but also makes you think: the thing is that the main component of coffee, caffeine, is a natural stimulant. In the modern world, this is the most widely used psychoactive component. Caffeine blocks the effect of adenosine, which strengthens the connections between neurons in the brain and causes the production of other types of neurotransmitters. All this leads to a stimulating effect and positively affects the brain and mood. Regular use of coffee can also help overcome emotional problems and improve cognitive abilities. Studies show that coffee improves thinking ability and problem-solving skills. 6) Coffee is good for the liver Caffeine in coffee helps self-regulation of the liver. Its regular consumption can reduce the risk of such diseases as liver cancer or cirrhosis, as well as liver failure. In addition, caffeine reduces the likelihood of alcoholic cirrhosis. These benefits dont apply to other caffeinated drinks, such as black and green tea. 7) Coffee reduces the risk of gout Gout is painful, and, which is even more sadly, it can affect any person at any age. It strikes the joints and can immobilize a person for quite a long time. Drinking coffee can relieve pain and soften gout. Those, who consume coffee few times a day, have less risk of developing gout. This is due to the same antioxidants, which lower the level of insulin and uric acid which cause gout. The cons of drinking coffee 1) Coffee kills vitamins Under the influence of caffeine, the body loses vitamin B1 which provides and regulates carbohydrate metabolism and the work of nerves. With its lack, the quality of the skin, memory, and hair deteriorates. So next time, think twice before drinking the sixth cup of coffee just to get a couple more hours of surfing the web, browsing your profile on the online dating site, or watching Netflix. 2) It can deplete the nervous system This is a result of the overdose, when coffee is too strong, and when you drink it too often. At the same time, the amount of substances that transmit signals to your nervous system is significantly reduced. Signs of nervous exhaustion include irritability, depression, frequent palpitation, and insomnia. To prevent this, you need to drink no more than 2-3 cups of coffee a day. 3) It washes off minerals from the body Due to the diuretic effect, coffee can wash off calcium, magnesium, and other minerals and trace elements from the body. Because of this, a person, who regularly consumes coffee even in normal doses, may experience weakness, depression, heart problems, and headaches. You can partly prevent the excretion of nutrients if you add milk to the drink and consume vitamins and food supplements containing minerals.",mzanzi stories,0

ZIMBABWE TO ZODWA: NO PANTY NO SHOW!,"ZIMBABWE TO ZODWA: NO PANTY NO SHOW! It turns out that club-dancer extraordinaire, Zodwa Wabantu, real name Zodwa Libram, has not been given the green light to take her no-panty act to Zimbabwe. In fact, the Zimbabwean Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry has banned Zodwa from performing at the Harare International Carnival on the 6th of September. This despite the fact that the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority has apologized for comments which they made about Zodwa at a press conference last week. The Daily Sun reported last week that the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority had booked Zodwa for a show, but only on condition that she cover the essentials. According to the Authority, Zodwas pantyless show would compromise their principles and offend the chiefs and traditional leaders in attendance. Zodwas response to that was simple, bayanya. It then emerged yesterday that Zimbabwe Tourism Authority had apologized to her and granted their permission for her act to go on as planned. But now, it is understood that despite the Authoritys apology, Zodwa is still banned from performing at the carnival, allegedly due a Zimbabwean actress complaining to the Zimbabwean Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry. A complaint was received from local actress Anne Nhira who questioned why it is that a South African was being hired to perform when there many young Zimbabweans who were working hard and are capable of doing the job. In a letter from the acting Minister of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Patrick Zhuwao tells Anne that Zodwa may not participate at the Harere International Carnival. In this regard, the relevant authorities have been notified, said Patrick. Zodwa has since told TshisaLive that she only found out about the complaint on social media. \""To be honest I don't even understand where she is coming from. If I was a nobody, I wouldn't have received the invite in the first place. So maybe it comes from a place of jealousy. Why would a person just randomly write such a letter?\"" Zodwa said. \""I will remain Zodwa whether I perform there or not. For her, people will now know who she is because of me,\"" she continued.

DJ Sbu leaving Vuma FM with immediate effect,"DJ Sbu leaving Vuma FM with immediate effect IT SEEMS DJ Sbu just cant avoid controversy. This after news that hes leaving Vuma FM, after less than a year since he joined the KZN-based commercial radio station. Sources at the station said it was unclear as to why the controversial DJ, whose real name is Sbusiso Leope, was leaving. They allege he doesnt see eye to eye with the new station manager. A source told Sunday Sun: When Sbu was introduced in June last year, management said he was expected to bring positive impact to the station. Sbu presents the DJ Sbu Breakfast on weekdays, which he also presents on the Vuma FMs sister station, Rise FM  which is based in Mpumalanga. A producer at the station said station manager, Pearl Sokhulu, wants to change the structure at Vuma FM and that doesnt sit well with DJ Sbu. Said the source: Pearl calls the shots as the station manager. She makes decisions, and some of the staff, including Sbu, hate some of her decisions. But theres nothing they can do as shes their boss. DJ Sbu was dismissed at Metro FM in 2015, after he advertised his Mofaya energy drink at the Metro FM Music Awards. Another source said at Vuma FM, Sbus allowed to promote his energy drink but Pearl wants to change all that. Just when he thought he finally had freedom to push his energy drink business, Pearl came in. Sbu even asks the shows guests to take selfies holding Mofaya. But that could end as Pearl wants to change things, said the second source. Vuma FM spokesperson, Tee van Heerden, confirmed DJ Sbu is leaving the station: Hes leaving us end of February. Asked if it DJ Sbu was leaving because of Pearl, Tee said she can only confirm that Sbu was leaving. Pearl and DJ Sbu could not be reached for comment. - Sunday Sun ",mzanzi stories,0

Fortunately, there are several natural ways to reduce the appearance of stretch marks. 1. Potato Juice Potato juice contains vitamins and minerals that foster growth and restoration of skin cells. Cut a medium-sized potato into thick slices.Take one of the potato pieces and rub it gently on the stretch marks for a few minutes. Make sure the liquid from the potato covers the affected area.Allow the potato juice to dry for some time and then wash it off with lukewarm water. 2. Sugar Natural white sugar is one of the best natural remedies to get rid of stretch marks. You can use the sugar to exfoliate your skin. Mix a tablespoon of raw sugar with some almond oil and a few drops of lemon juice. Mix it well and apply it on the stretch marks and other skin areas.Gently rub the mixture on the skin for at least 10 minutes every day before taking a shower. Do this for a month or so and watch your stretch marks become lighter. 3. Aloe Vera Aloe vera is effective in the treatment of many skin problems.

Agrizzi has spent the last eight days at the Zondo commission giving testimony about how Bosasa allegedly paid millions of rand in bribes to top government officials in exchange for contracts. The zondo commission listened to a tape in which Agrizzi was recorded making racial slurs, repeatedly. He told the commission that he knew they were recording him but didn't know it was a trap. He said he would love the commission to hear the bad part of the whole three hours of the clip which has never been played.

WONT TELL YOU HIS PASSWORD Putting security is a normal thing for everyone, but when it gets beyond normal is when your man wont tell you his password to his phone. If he cant give you the access to that phone then there is no doubt he has another chic that hes hiding from you. I mean, you are his lady hes supposed to let you in on everything, but when his security becomes more important than you then you should know there is another lady (or ladies) in the picture. 2. FREQUENTLY CHANGES HIS PASSWORD One trick men use is tell you their password today and change it the next day. He knows that you would become suspicious if he doesnt give you his password to his phone, so he cleverly tells you the pass and changes it later on, so you wont have to access his phone without asking him. 3. FEELS EDGY WHEN YOURE WITH HIS PHONE A call or message from his side chic could come in when you are with his phone, so this makes him uncomfortable when you are with his phone for long periods. Dont think because hes given you his phone then it means hes clean; if he acts edgy and strange then you should know that your man is probably cheating. 4. SWITCHES OFF HIS PHONE WHEN YOU AROUND Most ladies dont know this but it happens a lot. A lady once told me of her past relationship; she called off the relationship when she noticed that her man never receives calls when with her, not that calls wont come in but he smartly puts off his network so as to make his line unreachableif you ask me, Id say smart move, but it just shows he has numerous women in his life. So ladies, if your man is exhibiting any of these signs, you should toe the part of caution as there is every tendency that your man is cheating on you.",mzanzi stories,0
Breaking: My twin brother sl3pt with my wife,My twin brother sl3pt with my wife Having an identical twin has is advantages and disadvantages. As teenage boys we were very reckless and care free. We did the most cruel and crazy things for each other. One of the cruel things would be swaping for s**. He would sl3ep with all the girls I'd manage to bring home and I'd sleep with those he would manage to bring without them noticing a single thing. He would hit then say he is going to get some water then swap with me. We were so close and never did I think that he would ever do such a thing to me. I pissed him off when I changed the game cos I eventually found love and marry. I know he was very angry at me for changing but I didn't think he would ever stoop as low as sle3ping with the woman I love and married. How could my wife have not been able to tell that it wasn't me? I'm done with the both of them for good. ,mzanzi stories,0
Meet the big 5 students arrested for alleged murder of Thoriso Themane and one says his father will help him,"Meet the big 5 students from Capricorn High School in limpopo/ polokwane, Flora park who allegedly killed Thoriso Themane and one says his father will help him in a video. Friends of the man who was beaten to death and dumped in Flora Park, Polokwane, at the weekend on Tuesday expressed shock and dismay at the killing. The friends paid tribute to Thoriso Themane, who was alleged to have been beaten by a group of people. At least one learner from Capricorn High School is alleged to have been in the mob. Police have reportedly visited the school. The Limpopo education department expressed shock at the allegations that a pupil was involved. \""The Limpopo department of education is deeply horrified and saddened by allegations of murder in which a Capricorn High learner is said to be a suspect,\"" said spokesperson Sam Makondo. \""The incident has been captured on a video which has since gone viral. The suspect has today been taken in for questioning by the police.\"" Makondo said they did not immediately have the details of the incident, but a psycho-social team had been deployed to the school to provide counselling for learners. A former classmate of Themane's said that she was hurt by the manner in which he is believed to have died. \""We went to Flora Park Comprehensive high school and matriculated in 2011 together. He was the class clown who made everyone laugh,\"" said the woman, who asked not to be named. \""I hated the school but he made thing better,\"" she added. News of Themane's death trended on Tuesday as the #JusticeForThoriso gained traction on Twitter. Police said his body was found lying in the street on Sunday, at around 9.50am. \""The victim was taken to hospital but certified dead on arrival. The police were summoned and started with the initial investigations which revealed that the victim was assaulted by a group of people in the area. One person has been taken in for questioning,\"" police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe said in a statement. \""The motive behind this incident is not clear but the ongoing police investigations will tell us more,\"" he added.

He was a good guy and would have never hurt anyone.\"" Police reportedly went to Capricorn High School on Monday in connection with the incident. This came after another video surfaced showing a boy in school uniform being asked if he feels good about killing a person. The boy says yes because he knows that nothing will happen to him. The short dialogue happens in Sepedi. Asked how she felt about the allegations that Themane's killers could be children, the former classmate said: \""I think they should serve their time. They know what is right and wrong - they know there are consequences for their actions. The fact that they are minors cannot be used as an excuse.\"" Meanwhile, another friend expressed how Themane had escaped a near-death experience last year.",mzanzi stories,0

Pictures: Tavern Punani Dancer Makes Crowd Wild,"Tavern Punani Dancer Makes Crowd Wild - photos NOBODY KNOWS exactly where the video was taken or when it happened. But the beer was flowing, the punani was flashing . . . AND EXCITED PATRONS WERE HAVING THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES! One might say some activities are too private to be taken to the streets  or to a tavern. But the woman in the video clearly wasnt worried that she was surrounded by a cheering crowd and video cameras. The video, which is said to come from Tshwane, shows the woman in a short dress dancing and showing off her punani. In the video, a woman dressed in jeans dares the woman to come onto the dance floor and she rushes onto the stage to join in what looks like a dancing battle. The crowd cheers for the woman in jeans, which seems to challenge the woman in the dress even more. Guests go crazy when they see that shes not wearing panties. A woman in the background is heard saying: I cant believe what Im seeing! When two women try to stop her she falls to her knees, twerking to the sound of the popular amapiano music. A man shows his appreciation by slipping a R10 note between the womans twerking bum. A woman in white shorts comes onto the stage and twerks on top of the other woman. Ellen Segone, a cultural expert from Tshwane, said: Grown women should respect their bodies. We condemn this behaviour that seems to be becoming the norm in our society. Pastor Daniel Motsepe said women are not supposed to behave in this way. This is a shocking video. Women are not slaves to any substance, any amusement or any fashion or attitude that does not please their master in heaven. These women have involved themselves in lust and drunkenness. They should not do these things or become enslaved to anything but Christ.",mzanzi stories,0

Dont be like Mugabe and even worse, Malemas EFF condemns Zimbabwe Army brutality South Africas Economic Freedom Fighters party has warned President Mnangagwas government to handle protests with care and not to use disproportionate violence against unarmed protesting citizens. Below is a statement released by EFF: We extend our solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe who have taken to the streets to protest against increase in petrol prices. We call on the government of Zimbabwe to respond to these demonstrations with restraint. We particularly condemn the unleashing of the military on citizens. A democratic government knows too well that militaries are not entities used to respond to protesting, and defenseless citizens. To unleash military is to treat citizens as enemies of the state, who must be met with excessive violence, force and death, as militaries are death driven, only to be deployed to those who are armed and sworn enemies of the people. Militaries should never ever be used against protests and civil defiance demonstrations. The progressive international community celebrated the fall of Mugabe, with the hope that the era of human rights abuse , associated with his reign in Zimbabwe , will come to an end. President Mnangagwa is therefore consistent with the Mugabe administration violation of citizens rights to protest and civil disobedience.",mzanzi stories,0

Magadlela said it was an innocent case of the tickle game that she played with her daughter ever since she was two months old. Me and Amahle love to play this game, we do it every night. well, we did, Magadlela told police, very straight faced, calm and collective. I dont know, then she just stopped moving, she was laughing hard and then went silent. I dont know what went wrong. But I still have 6 other kids so i will just accept that this was Gods plan for Amahle. Ill miss her, but I guess it was just her fate. However, police are not quite buying Magadlela story about what happened during her innocent tickle game. Just by her statement she gave about what happened, I dont believe her, said acting chief of police Nhlanhla Mkhwanaz. The toddler had bruises all over her body, and were still waiting for the autopsy report. This mom claims they were tickling bruisesyeah right. Either way, she killed her daughter and she has this I dont care because I have more kids attitude and its really disgusting. Mkhwanaz says the prosecution is hoping for a first-degree murder charge if the autopsy results come back as they believe it will. As for now, Magadlela is being held in Bellair Police station in Durban with no bail. Her 6 other children have been placed in the care of Child Protective Services. ",mzanzi stories,0

Billionaire Prophet Bushiri gives Mboro R1m as a birthday gift,"Billionaire Prophet Shepherd Bushiri gives Prophet Mboro R1m as a birthday gift Paseka Motsoeneng, popularly known as Prophet Mboro, was given a late birthday surprise by colleague Shepherd Bushiri. Bushiris church, Enlightened Christian Gathering, organised a night of celebration for Mboro, who turned 50 early this year. Bushiri gave Mboro R1million cash as a birthday gift. For years, the two did not get along, but they seem to have put their differences aside. Bushiri said that if prophets did not celebrate each other, no one would love or honour them or take them seriously. It is not easy. If you look at traditional healers, they dont fight one another and they stand together. But men of God fight, we need to stand together. Our styles of ministry are different, but we serve one Jesus, Bushiri said. He added that when he saw Mboros work with his generous deeds and the impact he had made in peoples lives through healing and miracles, he had to celebrate the man of Gods life. A congregant said Mboro delivered her from her drinking addiction which was triggered by her divorce. I used to drink a lot. I would drink from 6pm to the next morning. I was a gangster and used to carry a gun. Most of my friends were men and you dont want to know what we used to do. I came to church and I found Jesus. I have now touched many lives through Mboros guidance, she said. Motsoeneng said he was very emotional after the gesture. He thanked everyone in attendance especially his mother. My mother is 88 years old and almost died this year and I asked the Lord to spare her life. I have built houses for many people but I felt I have not done enough for her so I am grateful for her life. Bushiri, youve almost brought tears in my eyes. I dont know what to say. Though we fight often, I dont hold grudges. Even the Bible says I should love my enemies, he said. According to him, being a prophet was extremely difficult but it is his love for the broken and needy that has kept him going.",mzanzi stories,0

"UK promoter rubbishes 'fake' Babes Wodumo gig, suing the star & invite King Monada to perform","United Kingdom promoter rubbishes 'fake' Babes Wodumo gig, suing the star and invite King Monada to perform. The organiser of an event local star Babes Wodumo was meant to perform at in the UK last month has told TshisaLIVE that he is suing the star for not pitching, amidst claims the show was a scam. Ndumiso Dlamini, also known as DJ Mkhukhwini, claims he had booked Babes to perform at an event in Leicester, England and Dublin, Ireland late last month. But the Wololo star only showed up at the Ireland gig after hearing that her grandmother had died. According to DJ Mkhukhwini, the star did not even make it to England, after missing her connecting flight to Abu Dhabi. Both parties took to social media at the time to announce the show had been cancelled and apologise to concertgoers. However, the promoter has confirmed to TshisaLIVE that he was filling a lawsuit against Babes Wodumo for breach of contract and defamation of character. I am taking legal action. They (Babes and her team) actually owe me a lot but Ive been advised not to say much by my legal team, he said, adding that he would do whatever it takes to clear his name and recover what he lost by refunding people for the show. SEE DETAILS H-E-R-E While Noxolo has not been on screen as often as His lawyer Ryan Tucker told TshisaLIVE that they were taking council to begin with action against the star, but could not comment on the amount they were seeking in damages from her. Babes manager Nondumiso Simelane did not respond to several requests from TshisaLIVE for comment, but told Daily Sun that they had gone to the venue in England where she claims they were told the venue had not been paid for. Travelling to the UK, we heard about our gogos death, but because Babes didnt want to disappoint people, we went to England. When we got to the venue, we were told it wasnt paid for. Mkhukhwini still owes us money for the gig, but we decided to let it go. Screenshots of an Instagram post, seemingly from Babes page shortly after the fiasco, repeated the claims against the promoter. DJ Mkhukhwini's Facebook page also contains several posts from angry fans with similar claims and accusing him of misleading them so he could make off with their money. The promoter laughed off the suggestion but refused to go into details about the event's logistics. He said that any such claims against him were \""100% lies\"".

Update on Capricorn High School Students in polokwane from Flora park who killed Thoriso Themane - 5 pupils arrested,"Update on Capricorn High School Students from Flora park who killed Thoriso Themane - Five teen student arrested The murder of a 27-year-old man, Thoriso Themane, allegedly by pupils of Capricorn High School in Limpopo, has shocked the country as videos of the murder circulated on social media, and one of the suspects boasted that his father would protect him. Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed on Tuesday that the Polokwane police were investigating a case of murder in Flora Park, a leafy suburb near the central business district of Polokwane, over the weekend. According to police information, the man had been arguing with a group of pupils who were at the school over the weekend. The pupils then allegedly brutally assaulted him, throwing stones and dragging him on to a public road, while several recorded videos and cracked jokes during the assault. The bruised and bloody man was discovered by motorists who called the police. According to police records, the attack happened on Sunday at about 9.50am. WATCH VIDEO HERE On arriving at the scene, police found the man lying along a street. He was taken to the hospital where he was certified dead on arrival. Initial investigations revealed that the victim had been assaulted by a group of people in the area and one person was taken in for questioning. The motive behind this incident is not clear at this stage, but ongoing investigations will find the exact cause. One Flora Park resident, who said her child was a pupil at the school, said the parents were worried that only a few of the pupils, who did not have ties with the powers that be at the local police station, were called in for questioning. This was after it emerged that the father of one suspected killer in the group was a high-ranking police officer. We want all children identified to have taken part in the assault and the killing of the man to be named and shamed. Otherwise justice will not be served in this matter, because only the haves are treated with velvet gloves and the poor and the lesser known differently, said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Ngoepe said five pupils between the ages of 15 and 17 years were arrested and further arrests would be determined by the outcome of investigations. Democratic Alliance (DA) provincial chairperson Jacques Smalle called on the Limpopo department of education to beef up security at the school. According to the reports received by the DA, the use of drugs cannot be ruled out in the boys wayward actions. Some of these children are seen on the video bragging about the gruesome incident. That is so heartless. The life of a person is not tantamount to that of a locust. It takes a lot of guts to fight a person, let alone kill them. It is therefore very important for the authorities to check all the angles and take drastic action against the offenders, said Smalle. The provincial department of educations spokesperson Sam Makonde said no official statements or reports had been sent from the school, but the department had received information from the police. The department had dispatched a psychosocial team to the school to provide counselling so the focus returns to teaching and learning while the law takes its course.",mzanzi stories,0

Caster Semenya Loses Testosterone Fight,"aster Semenya Loses Testosterone Fight South African runner Caster Semenya today lost her court challenge against IAAF rules forcing female athletes to regulate their testosterone levels, but judges voiced concern with the application of the discriminatory regulations. Semenya, a double Olympic champion, was fighting measures imposed by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) that compel hyperandrogenic athletes  or those with differences of sexual development (DSD)  to lower their testosterone levels if they wish to compete as women. A three judge panel at the Court of Arbitration for Sport said it had some serious concerns as to the future practical application of these DSD regulations. Even though the regulations are discriminatory such discrimination is a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of achieving the IAAFs aim of preserving the integrity of female athletics in the Restricted Events, the Lausanne-based court said in a statement. The IAAF insisted the rules were essential to preserve a level playing field and ensure that all female athletes can see a path to success. The verdict is certain to cause controversy, as Semenya was backed by a global coalition of nations and scientific experts who argued that testosterone is an arbitrary and unfair measure for determining gender. Experts also stressed that achieving excellence in sport is a combination of training and commitment as well as genetics and that barring people from competition over a single genetic factor has no scientific basis. In a rare intrusion into the world of sport, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution last month branding the IAAF rules unnecessary, humiliating and harmful. The IAAF has countered that DSD athletes with male levels of testosterone get the same increases in bone and muscle size and strength and increases in haemoglobin that a male gets when they go through puberty. Semenyas testosterone levels are not publicly known, but she is unlikely to be the only athlete affected by Wednesdays verdict. The two athletes who finished behind her in the Rio Olympics 800m, Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi and Kenyas Margaret Wambui, have also faced questions about their testosterone levels. However, the judges want the IAAF to apply the rules only up to the 800m because the evidence was not clear that women with hyperandrogenism have a competitive advantage in the 1 500m. The CAS Panel suggested that the IAAF consider deferring the application of the DSD Regulations to these events (1 500m and the mile) until more evidence is available, the court said. That could give Semenya a route to compete at the world championships without taking medication. She was the bronze medalist in the 1 500m at the 2017 worlds in London. A further appeal is possible to Switzerlands supreme court in Lausanne. Federal judges rarely overturn CAS decisions, but can intervene if legal process was abused.",mzanzi stories,0

Prophet Alec Ndiwane who is based in the Pretoria Soshanguve was with fellow church members in the Kruger National Park where they were watching animals.It is believed the prophet went into a trance and started to speak in tongues. Ahead of them was a lion pride busy eating their impala. Alec must have thought he was the biblical Samson as the prophet opened the car door and went charging towards the lions. Upon seeing the man running towards them, the lions could not believed that manna was coming straight from heaven and instead ran towards the prophet. Alec must have then come to his senses as he quickly realised this was not going to end well and made an immediate turn and ran back to safety. But before he could safely reach the confines of the car, one lion had snapped its paws on him thus causing major damage to his toilet sitting tool. Also thanks to the game ranger who was near who fired some shots with his gun to scare the lion away. So severe was the lion paw injury that Alec had to be rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. The man was fearing he would lose his bum but the doctors assured him he would still have his left bum intact. I do not know what came over me, Alec confessed, I thought the Lord wanted to use me to show his power over animals. Is it not we were given dominion over all creatures of the earth, Alec added. Alec was eventually stitched up and discharged after spending the night in hospital.",mzanzi stories,0

Miss Melanie Ollier is a teacher at this school and she bullied a student until the student opted to taking her own life. The student's name was Nicole Mnguni and her story was shared on facebook and it sparked outrage. Here is her story: Nicole Mnguni took her life after she returned from school to fetch her report which was not given to her, though her mom wrote a letter to the school pleading that they give her the report because she can't make it, but they still couldn't give Nicole Mnguni her report. The girl has been a victim of harassment done by her Mathematics teach Miss Melanie Ollier, the school is aware of the case between the teacher and the pupil but couldn't take further action, the pupil wrote a letter to the district in September presenting her case however her plea fell to deaf ears, as there was no action taken against the Mathematics teacher, who mocked her, called her all sorts of names and she bumped she into the very same teacher at school, the teacher said to her, \""she is stuck with her\"" the little girl left a very sad suicide note which was found by the mother Jeska Mnguni. The suicide note left by Nicole goes into deep detail and how she couldn't go back to school to Miss Melanie Ollier, the mother found her daughter dead in their home kitchen in Klipspruit. The school is aware of that one of the teachers has been harassing this little girl but couldn't act, even now they haven't made contact with the mom only the district did. Police at Kliptown police station have opened a case against the accused. We want the school to be aware that we are aware that they're doing nothing to show sympathy to the Mnguni family. This story was first posted on facebook and after the post a lot of other students of hers and former students of hers came out and told their stories of how she drove them to depression and anxiety where they also had suicide thoughts.

"Bushiri - I announce the sudden passing on of our great worshipper, James Nee who died early this morning in a car accident.","Prophet Shepherd Bushiri - It is with great sadness that I announce the sudden passing on of our great worshipper, James Nee who died early this morning in a car accident. I learnt that James along with my other two sons Beston Khamba and Brain Glant were traveling in a vehicle that collided with a truck and in the process overturned and claimed the life of all three of them. When one of our own goes to sleep tragically, we often ask ourselves so many questions. And while we might not have answers to all of them, we should however be comforted in knowing that those who leave us are only sleeping and they will wake up again when Christ comes back. But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope (1 Thess. 4:13). I know that, though life often requires us to, we are never ready to say goodbye to those we love. Thoughts of spending days without their presence is often an extremely dawning thought. And it often seems like we have all the time in the world, only to realize how fleeting time really is. But our faith in Christ has taught us this one thing, that death will never be proud. WATCH PICTURES H-E-R-E The matter is under investigation. As news of Jamess death broke, tributes continued to pour in on social media for the renowned singer, writer, producer, and businessman. Death is not about dying at an old age because even Jesus died at a young age of 33. But death is about moving away from the physical once you have fulfilled your destiny in Christ. It is about resting whilst awaiting the second coming of Christ where we shall spend eternity with Him. You have touched the hearts of so many who owe you a lifetime of gratitude my Sons. You worshipped God relentlessly. Travelled the globe with the aim of making Jesus known. You were a great part of ensuring that souls were won to Christ. Your dedication, commitment, submission and loyalty to God have left an example through which millions will follow. I am not saying goodbye forever but goodbye for now, for one day we shall join you as we cry holy holy holy to God alongside the 24 elders in heaven. As tears flow from my eyes with a heart heavy with the weight of losing you, I will also celebrate your life because you have taught so many the true meaning of living. Living for God! You were and are still an inspiration to all, with a heart that radiated love and warmth through all our lives. You will truly be missed and forever remembered. I love you, thank you for making me a very proud Dad! I, therefore urge all my son's and daughters to join in prayer as we celebrate the lives of my sons.

Gautrain faces possible court action for chasing a man 'Thando Mahlangu' wearing Ndebele clothes,"Gautrain faces possible court action for chasing a man wearing Ndebele clothes Gautrain faces possible court action after a man dressed in traditional Ndebele garb was not allowed to board a train because he was not dressed \""appropriately\"". More than a week ago, Thando Mahlangu was asked to leave the operator's Park Station in Johannesburg. His lawyer, Benny Buthelezi, told Talk Radio 702's Bongani Bingwa on Thursday that Mahlangu had been humiliated. He added that \""it is a point that needs to be ventilated at the highest level in-country\"". During the interview, Buthelezi also accused Gautrain's top management of failing to deal with the issue and of supporting its security guards' decision to bar Mahlangu from boarding a train. Mahlangu also wants compensation, claiming that he lost money he could have made from a business meeting he couldn't attend. Gautrain CEO Jack van der Merwe told the radio station that he had apologised to Mahlangu. But Buthelezi claims that the apology was only made through the media and social media. Gauteng's Transport MEC Ismael Vadi also weighed in on the matter and said it was unacceptable that the 34-year-old was turned away simply because of what he was wearing. ",mzanzi stories,0
My kak can save Eskom - Thabo 19 years old generates electricity from kak," My kak can save Eskom - Thabo generates electricity from kak 19 years old Thabo Ramatse generates electricity from poop and he hopes this idea will save Eskom! ]WHEN others answer natures call, Thabo Ramatse generates power. The 19-year-old from Klipspruit, Soweto, told Daily Sun he uses human kak to make electricity. And if there is enough of it, he hopes to solve the countrys power generation problems. He said he got the idea from his mum, who told him about a woman who had fallen into a pit toilet and died because of the heat in the hole. This made me realise pit toilets have loads of power, he said. In 2015 he decided to test his theory. First Thabo caught kak fumes in a plastic squeeze bottle. He closed the lid and threw the bottle into a fire. When the bottle popped before it caught fire he carried on with his experiment. I scraped nails with sandpaper and dipped them in methanol before I attached the nails to a wire. I inserted the wire inside a pit toilet where the kak was boiling. Then I attached the wire to a light bulb. The heat from the human waste heated up the wire and the bulb lit up. The energy that Thabo creates is similar to what happens inside your stomach when you eat food. Kak gradually gets broken down into biogas. Thabo wants government to use his idea to create jobs for unemployed young people. He said he was trying to find ways to generate electricity using acid and turbines.",mzanzi stories,0
Grade 12 student killed for Carvella shoes he wore to matric dance,"Top Learner killed for Carvella shoes he wore to matric dance A Kimberley pupil was stabbed to death and robbed of a pair of Carvella shoes that he had proudly worn to his matric dance just two nights before. It is believed that the Grade 12 pupil from Emmanuel Secondary School was walking with friends during the early hours of Sunday morning when they were approached by a group of men who were armed with knives. The boys family, as well as the school, is still reeling in shock over the tragedy. Relatives have urged the public to be on the lookout for the stolen shoes as they believe that this could lead the police to the suspects, who have yet to be arrested. It is a brown pair of size 9 Carvela shoes with a buckle. Joseph Ndlovu said on Monday that he had saved for months to buy the shoes for his eldest son, Boniface Ndlovu, to wear to his matric dance this past Friday. Boniface was so happy and proud to be able to wear his shoes. His mother is heartbroken and the entire family is traumatised, said Joseph. Boniface was accompanying one his friends home at the time of the incident. We were sleeping when we received the news that he had been stabbed. By the time we arrived on the scene near the sports field, near Stock and Stock, he had already died. It is very painful to have to bury your own child. Joseph believes that the streets of Kimberley are not safe. I dont want my other two sons and two daughters walking in the streets after dark any more. He said they were still busy planning the funeral arrangements, although they are hoping to hold the service this weekend. Bonifaces uncle, Andre van Rooyen, added that the rest of his nephews friends had managed to flee from the group of armed men. It was dark, so they said they could not remember much because everything happened so fast. Some of their shoes and belongings were also stolen in the process, said Van Rooyen. He added that according to the autopsy results, Boniface was stabbed twice in the heart. The stab wounds were fatal. There was no chance that he would have survived. Boniface was one of the top 10 academic pupils at his school. His dream was to join the South African National Defence Force and study engineering. He had submitted an online application to the University of Stellenbosch on Friday. The deputy principal of Emmanuel Secondary School, Gladys Poonawassy, said that counselling had been arranged for pupils at the school on Monday. Psychologists and social workers provided counselling to the teachers and pupils and a youth pastor from CRC church prayed over them and provided support. We are all shaken over what happened. The Grade 12s were supposed to write Geography on Monday but we have postponed the exams until Thursday. Poonawassy added that Boniface was one of the schools top achievers. He was a hard worker who was dedicated to his studies and was extremely well behaved, well mannered, with a great personality. It is a huge loss for the school. She said that the matric dance that was held on Friday went smoothly, without any incident. The matrics did not even attend an after-party as they are busy writing exams. Poonawassy said a memorial service would be held at the school hall at 1pm on Thursday. Members from the school community and pupils will also attend and assist with the funeral. Police spokesperson Sergeant Majang Skalkie said that the Galeshewe police were looking for information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects. Skalkie said that the deceased, aged 17 years old, was apparently approached by a group of 10 men who were armed with knives. The incident occurred on Sunday, March 10 between 12.30am and 1am at a sports ground at Stock and Stock in Galeshewe. The deceased was walking with four of his schoolmates from Homevale to Galeshewe when they were approached by approximately 10 unknown men armed with knives. They allegedly robbed them of their shoes, clothes and stabbed the deceased. Skalkie stated that the victim was stabbed twice in the chest and died on the scene. No suspects have been arrested yet. She appealed to the community to contact the investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Steven Wax, on 082 469 1728 if they had any information relating to the incident.

I just really have a huge problem with social media, you've seen how toxic I feel about the space.\"" WATCH VIDEO H-E-R-E I'm just so upset, it's so upsetting that people on social media, you literally go all the way out to always find something wrong with someone, and then use that to bring someone down. I generally don't get it, I don't understand it. What do you gain from doing that? What happens after that? You've broken someones self esteem down and then what. I'm so upset!?\"" Mvelo said that she's been trying to block out how she's been made fun of on social media but the meme was so upsetting because her head isn't that big and that her hairstyle wasn't as intensified as it was made out to be when the meme was created. Her Insta Live video was shared by a number of people who supported her for addressing the issue. Mvelo also pleaded for people to do better with their behaviour when it comes to these social media platforms.",mzanzi stories,0
ZCC Lekganyane Builds P10m Clinic In Mmopane & a High school and this is not trending bcz it's not a miracle - Pictures,"Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane Builds P10m million Clinic In Mmopane & a High school and this is not trending bcz it's not a miracle The Zion Christian Church better known as ZCC (Naledi) has built a P10 million clinic for residents of Mmopane Block 1 and near-by villages. The clinic is named after the church's Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane's grandmother Mahlaku Lekganyane. According to Lekganyane, his grandmother was a loving woman who was given wisdom by God that her children needed more than bread to live. He said Mahlaku had six children whom she taught to live a Christian life. My grandmother was also a loving person. She taught her children to love other people. She believed in the word kamoka, where she believed that good things could be achieved when people unite and work together as one. She had a sense of community. The Republic of Botswana and South Africa are one today henceforth, he said. Accepting the churchs good deed, the Minister of Health and Wellness Dorcas Makgato, said the donation of the clinic could not have come at any better as the government was engaged in coming up with strategies aimed at improving healthcare. She added that their healthcare system had over the years grown from strength to strength with primary healthcare as its cornerstone. She said in pursuit of quality and safe healthcare services, the government has invested in major health infrastructure. Makgato further explained that they built healthcare facilities that deliver healthcare services at different level of care. She added that those developments ensured that healthcare services were within reach of their communities. The process of establishing this clinic started in October 2015 and it has been achieved today with the help of our Public Private Partnership from Kganya Botswana, a product of the ZCC. I am reliably informed that Kganya Botswana has spent over P9 million to erect this clinic, she said. She said since Mmopane Block 1 had estimated population of 40,655, it was imperative that its community members have access to medical services. She said they could have built a clinic in the area back in 2010, but due to financial constraints, their goals ran futile till the church came to their rescue. The Mahlaku Lekganyane Clinic has 21 rooms which include the reception area, screening room, consultation and observation rooms, child welfare room, restroom for health officers, pharmacy and laundry room. The clinic will be opened for eight hours. According to the minister, 5,395 patients had already been consulted during the trials since last year November to date. According to the former Vice President, Ponatshego Kedikilwe, the clinic started off as an idea between him and the churchs bishop back in 2014 when he expressed his concern over various issues affecting Batswana such as HIV and AIDS and other health-related challenges. Upon the Bishops second visit, he expressed interest in building a clinic and that is when a few areas were selected of which after investigations we found it fit to build a clinic in Mmopane Block 1. MoHW helped us find the construction company, which was given nine months to have finished the job. The building was constructed in September last year and was finished in May this year, he said. Kedikilwe encouraged the community to take care of itself. He further explained that the relevance of church was to care for both members and those who do not follow it. He stated that all the churches must follow suit the examples of ZCC and practice what they preach. According to community member, who is also a task force member, Ethel Gumede, the clinic would help her community because they would no longer have to travel long distances to access health services. She said they used to get access to health facilities in nearby areas such as Nkoyaphiri, Metsimotlhabe and Mmopane clinic that were always congested. I however, urge the ministry to make this clinic operate 24 hours as we really need access to health facilities in Mmopane Block 1. We would like to have a doctor as our clinic does not have one, she ended.",mzanzi stories,0

She now lives in Mangaung with her boyfriend, Tshepo Monyane (32), who understands her condition. According to reports Tshokolo, who has her monthly periods, said she wanted to have an operation to remove the 4-5 and can be left with the punani. I was 10 when I saw I wasnt like other kids. I had to move out of my kasi because people judged me. I just want to live a normal life and believe Im not the only one with two different private parts. People must stop calling us names. What I have is not a curse. Tshepo said they have been together for three years. I was shocked at first, but have accepted her the way she is. Health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said Tshokolo has not asked for a sex change. She should visit Pelonomi Poly Clinic for counselling and will be referred for surgery according to her needs.

Although Daily Sun has written several stories about it going wrong, the trend seems to continue. The SunTeam recently went out to ask women about their thoughts on korobela. Mavis Sithole (33) from Leondale, Ekurhuleni, said she once used korobela because she was worried about losing her man. The problem started when I stopped loving him. I had to get that thing removed. Sphimphiwe Mthembu (36) said she trapped her man with korobela because he was a cheater. I love my man and I was not going to lose him to another woman. Sibongile Nyathi (28) from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, said she tried it and it went wrong as her man started cheating. I still regret giving him korobela because I lost him to another woman. I strongly discourage women from doing this, she said. Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi warned women that korobela caused diseases. This isnt good. Love is in a persons heart, not in their body.

10 Year Old girl Falsely Accuse Madala Of Rape - Must watch,"10 Year Old girl Falsely Accuse Madala Of Rape - Must watch AN angry mob surrounded a madala and beat him for raping a 10-year-old girl! Luckily, the cops rescued the innocent man and took him to hospital, where he is fighting for his life, although the mob set his shack ablaze. And in the aftermath of this violence, it has emerged that the girl who accused him was lying. She did not sleep at home and would not answer questions about her whereabouts. But when pressed, she said she had been raped. Resident Pule More (38) from Dinoheng, a kasi near Maokeng in Kroonstad, told Daily Sun that the girls family was worried when she didnt return home on Friday. We later discovered that she lied about the rape to cover up where she was on the day. Her story got out of control and it turned a vengeful mob on an innocent man. Pule said the madala had pleaded with residents. He swore he did nothing to the girl but it was in vain. They kept beating him until the cops were called and rescued him, he said. Another resident said: We wasted no time when the girl claimed she was raped and knew the suspect so we took the law into our own hands. Its bad to hear the man was falsely accused but we wanted to send a clear message to rapists and show them how we will deal with them. Police spokesman Constable Peter Kareli said a case of assault had been opened. During an interview with the police, in the presence of her parents, the child admitted she lied about the rape.",mzanzi stories,0

I did not know what a Sister Bettina was so I googled it and I was very confused. I did not ask Lerato about it because I thought it was impossible, why would she do that?. That was until we had a function at school where parents were invited too and they requested her class to sing the national anthem. The principal said over thirty children were singing Sister Bettina word for word. The parents were not happy at all. One parent said she wanted to beat up Lerato for teaching her children her ratchet ways. Police were called and everyone was calmed down. Lerato refused to apologise.

Deborah told the CRL Commission the offer was made two weeks after her mum Sarah Mohlala (70) was buried. Sarah died during a stampede at the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church on 28 December. The offer felt like a bribe, said Deborah. She said money would not take away the pain of losing her mum. Deborah said the church invited her to visit a branch in Rustenburg, but she refused. What if they do something bad to me? I dont trust them. SEE VIDEO H-E-R-E She said Bushiri kept saying he wanted to meet the family, but when the opportunity came he didnt speak to them. And they believe it's because after you sacrifice a person you can not go to their funeral or have contact with their family. We saw him at the hearing, but instead of talking to us he walked off without even greeting us. Bushiris lawyer, Terence Baloyi, said he never offered anyone money. We gave each family R 40 000 to help with the burial. More money will only be paid out if the commission directs us to do so, said Baloyi.

Idols SA finalist Mmatema Moremi's star is on the up.,"Idols SA finalist Mmatema Moremi's star is on the up. After losing out on Idols SA glory two years ago to Karabo Mogane, she now steps out as an actress. Moremi has been announced as one of the leading faces of the SABC2 drama Bone of My Bones. She plays Thembi, a school teacher married to Karabo Mohlala, played by the award winning Aubrey Poo. The drama that promises to be gripping unfolds as Karabo, a musician wanna-be, struggles to break into the music industry. This leaves a frustrated Thembi to bear the brunt of being the bread winner who keeps the family afloat financially on a modest school teacher's salary. Moremi gushed: \""There's a first time for everything, I am excited about the role and feeling blessed to a part of such an accomplished cast as this. The role puts me in a different light from the singing girl everyone loves. \""I've always wanted to sing. I didn't grow up wanting to act, I discovered it in high school and in tertiary my love for it grew further. I decided to go for lessons from Fumani Shilubana, who acted as Detective Dabula on Isidingo. When I got the opportunity from Idols I decided to use it to show off my other talents, including this.\"" Moremi was the leading lady in the stage musical A Tribute to the Manhattan Brothers at Soweto Theatre last year. Not that Moremi has turned her back on music. In fact, she will be recording her debut album live on March 3 at Atterbury Theatre in Pretoria. She said of the album: \""It's called The Definition of Me; people will get to find out more about this woman they love so much. I am a born- again child of the most high, woman of God. Expect songs that will speak to normal people, especially women. \""I'm independent on this one, only using a live band. My secret has always been prayer. And I have a lot of surprises and announcements to share.\"" Her spokeswoman Zandile Xan Moeketsi shared that Moremi doesn't hold back on the album. \""It's a spiritual soul album. The songs are about God and general life challenges. It is an album that caters for everyone. Although Mmatema is a Christian, in this album she concedes that there are other life challenges. The other songs speak about being a woman who gets asked out and she expresses her other relationships.\"" Source: sowetan live",mzanzi stories,0
Pastor heavily beats up female congregant for coming to church drunk (watch video),"Pastor heavily beats up female congregant for coming to church drunk (watch video) Church leader beats young woman for drinking alcohol: Video. The young woman who is being assaulted is seen in the churchs uniform and can be heard apologising repeatedly to the woman doing the beating as other church members cheer on. The young woman can be heard apologising repeatedly to the church leader who is giving her a hiding. South Africans were enraged by a video of church leaders, allegedly from the Endumisweni Faith Mission in Mdantsane, beating a young woman with a water pipe at the churchs NU8 branch. The woman beating the young woman has been identified by social media users as founder and leader of Endumisweni Gospel Group, Tsidi Spampool. Her name Tsidi Spampool, founder and leader of Endumisweni Gospel Group. She is notoriously known for doing this at Endumisweni Faith Mission-Nu8. The girl she is assaulting is not her daughter. Members of the church allegedly refer to her as The Angel, whatever she says, goes, said @SpitchNzawumbi on Twitter. In the video, she is heard talking about the young woman drinking alcohol and posting it on social media. Church leader Asivo Nosenga told the Dispatch that beating unruly children was part of the churchs disciplinary methods. Who are they trying to show that they are drinking while they are under a church that is [well] known [in the community]. We are trying to protect children from outside influences such as drugs; these are girls and they will get drunk and [can then] become rape victims, they were quoted as saying. The video angered South Africans, who took to social media to voice their opinions. Shouldnt she be praying for them rather? Kanti what does religion say about this? The brutality of it. What has she learnt here exactly, said one user, while another said: This is so wrong and the church is in the mix of things. Mina if someone were to beat my child like that Id go to church and punish her, open a case of assault period. we cant deal with abuse whether is done by men or woman abuse isnt right at all.

Mboro rescues Lundi tyamara from a public hospital to a private hospital,Mboro rescues Lundi tyamara from a public hospital to a private hospital Pastor Mboro has confirmed that he has made an offer to the family of gospel singer Lundi Tyamara to pay for him to be moved to a private hospital. The Pastor visited with the star who remains in a serious condition in hospital last week. Mboro said he was at a restaurant when someone showed him a picture of an ailing Lundi. The image which went viral on social media shortly after it emerged earlier this month had his family outraged at the breach of privacy. Mboro said he immediately made contact with Lundis manager to offer his prayers and possible financial assistance. The manager called and said Lundi agreed but on one condition: I should come alone. When I got in the hospital patients and staff members started asking me to pray for them. Lundi was happy to see me and I prayed for him. He stood up due to the excitement and he was instructed to sit down but I told them that they should let him exercise his faith. The controversial pastor said he was not happy with the hospital Lundi is in and offered to take him to a private hospital at his own expense. I said the hospital that Lundi was admitted to is not sufficient enough then I offered to take Lundi to a private hospital for admission and to pay for his medication at my own expense. Mboro told TshisaLIVE that the family said they would consider the offer. The Mphefumlo Wami hitmaker has been in and out of hospital since December.

"\""F*ck You White Man\""  Well Known Farmer Survives Racist Farm Attack, Only To Be Refused Treatment at Local Hospital!","While Mainstream Media are pandering to black people?s hurt fweelings over dry hair, a hospital in Kroonstad has refused medical treatment to a well known farmer, who was attacked by a black male wielding a panga and two knives, shouting \""F*ck you White man\""! Note the attacker did not just say \""man\"", or \""farmer\"", or \""South African\"", or \""human\"", he said \""WHITE man\"", making this a racist attack. But Sarel Wessels? problems did not end there, he had to treat his own wounds after a local hospital refused to treat the wounded farmer, despite him being a citizen and employer! But Ramaphosa?s \""our people\"" at the hospital had a handy excuse, fear of the CCP-virus, so he had to make do without hospital treatment and treat himself. Anti white sh*ithole much? Mr Wessels is also afraid that the black male attacker, will come back to harm him or his workers, after the attacker told Mr Wessels that he will see him again. He says he can still see the shiny blades coming for him when he closes his eyes. Sarel Wessels Farm AttackThe incident began on Wednesday morning 9th September, when he was away from the farm and workers of Mr. Wessels phoned him to say an unknown black male had stabbed a female worker, in the neck, on the farm and left her for dead. Mr. Wessels told Netwerk24 he rushed back to the farm, but he saw the suspect on the tar road to Welkom before he got home. Mr Wessels said he stopped by the suspect and told him in Sotho to put down the knifes. The suspect then stormed Mr Wessels with 2 knifes in one hand and a panga in the other hand ? after racially abusing him shouting \""f*ck you white man\"". What is with with all the racist swearing from Ramaphosa?s \""our people\"", using the F word towards whites during the last few days? The EFF also did the same when they taunted and harassed white people at shopping malls the last couple of days. But dare let a white person say F-ing Black man and the anti white mainstream hounds will pounce! Indeed, this deeply racist behaviour is ignored by our liberal media and as always they accommodate the real racists with wall to wall coverage, exactly what the ANC, EFF & SACP wants. Why? Because the perpetrators are black and black zombie pawns are the easy path to power for globalists and communists? The attacker succeeded in stabbing Mr Wessels in his forearm, elbow and side, with the same knife he previously stabbed the female worker, who is HIV positive, it turned out later! Mr Wessels said he then ran for his life and locked himself in his bakkie, and phoned for help. He said the wounds bled a lot and the whole interior of the bakkie was smeared with blood. The suspect was arrested when the Police and farm workers arrived on the scene while Mr Wessels sought help from a local hospital, but was sent away, because the medical staff were afraid he had COVID-19. He treated his own wounds and injected himself against tetanus. His workers don?t know the suspect and the suspect threatened Mr Wessels he will be back when the Police took him, leaving Mr Wessels in fear for his life, because it is a certainty that the attacker will be released by ANC staffed SAPS in no time.

"VIDEO: Hero Ouma Pulls Gun on Racist EFF Protesters Grabbing Her & Shouting \""You F*ing B*tch Go Back To Europe\"" Outside Clicks!","During an altercation with EFF protesters outside a Clicks store in Walmer Park Shopping Centre in Port Elizabeth yesterday, the aggressive EFF members where shouting \""You F*ing B*tch Go Back to Europe\"" at a grey-haired woman and her elderly friend. The EFF members then grabbed at her neck shouting at her to \""Take out your gun, Take out your gun\"", which she promptly did, in self defense! Clearly the EFF members were looking for trouble as voices could be heard shouting \""Shoot, shoot\"" ? they know, like George Floyd?s family, if they become a victim, they can win the lottery. The EFF members have since laid a charge of pointing of a firearm against the 52 year old white woman in Port Elizabeth, but with the way the EFF member was grabbing at her throat and her being outnumbered, and being a frail elderly women, she was perfectly justified in pulling her weapon. The woman pulled the gun out ? with surely zero intention to actually use it ? after a rowdy black EFF woman told the white woman, who was only trying to do some shopping, the following: \"" You f*cking bitch, go back to Europe\"". Mall security had to protect the white woman from the EFF women who were taunting and following her and also trying to physically attack her prior to her pulling a gun out. If video does not load above, watch video here: https://youtu.be/qeUZnmvikUc The elderly white woman was severely provoked by fascist EFF members, who were participating in a national campaign of terrorism and criminality being executed by the EFF against a legitimate business group, namely Clicks. This campaign of violence and terrorism against Clicks is being carried out on instruction of the rude black supremacist goon Julius Malema who ordered his minions to \""attack\"" Clicks. Now they are even singing \""Kill the Boer, Kill the Farmer\"" outside some stores, all over an advert for dry hair, made by a black owned company! This was quite clearly incitement to violence which was interpreted by EFF supporters to also mean an attack on white people, although the Clicks ad which led to the ridiculous EFF fauxrage was on initiative of black EFF executives. Why does the Police not investigate charges of incitement to violence and terrorism against EFF leaders? Because they are black? Why did the Police arrest that white woman in the first place? She was initially arrested, then released. They can arrest 300 000 people for lockdown violations but they cannot arrest real criminals like Malema? The protesters were removed from the store by police. The high court in Johannesburg had issued an order in which it restrained the EFF and those acting on its instructions from intimidating and threatening the employees of Clicks or any of its operations. The order also interdicted the party from inciting violence against the ordinary commercial operations of Clicks. ",sa-news,0
"#SanctionSA Racist ANC Lied to UN: \""Merit, and Merit Alone must Be Criterion For Selecting Teams\""  Yet 50 Years Later Race Based Selection is Good?","SA SANCTIONS: By the ANC?s own 50 year old demands, World Rugby, International Cricket Council (ICC), FIFA, International Olympic Committee (IOC), World Athletics, International Cycling Union (UCI), UN and all International Sports Governing bodies, should ban South African sports teams and implement sanctions against the ANC Regime! Francois Pienaar and all the high and mighty, holier than thou administrators, sportsmen, and their fans, are just as hypocritical as the ANC, who clearly will say or do anything, just to gain or hold on to power. When will the world learn that the Left only want power, by any and all means possible, forget whether something is right or good ? Black Lives Matter is a nasty example of this, and it is all driven by you, the silent voting public, whose silence is taken as consent. Good men have remained silent, the evil ones have been extremely vocal, and now evil prospers. It is SA-News? mission to address this imbalance. According to information from the far Left Wing SAhistory organisation website, which claims to be unbiased, but is funded by and blows only the left?s horn, there used to be a time when the ANC demanded that sports selection in South Africa should completely non racial and based purely on merit. They even had a left wing team in Britain write up a long diatribe to send to the United Nations, demanding that sanctions be placed against South Africa and that South African sports teams be banned from participating in International sports competitions. Well mandela himself said that if the ANC does what apartheid did to them, then we must do to the ANC what the ANC did to Apartheid, so clearly it is time for a clarion call to action, to implement sanctions against South Africa and to ban its sports teams from international competitions. This is the logical course of action in response to the race based quota system the ANC regime has implemented in SA, and not only on the sports field, but in ALL walks of life. Clearly, if you agree with racial quotas in sport, then you too are a racist hypocrite like the ANC! We sit with a situation where SA?s best sports talent is simply emigrating and playing for the other teams. In the long list of demands and justifications written for the ANC by learned left wingers in Britain, to be sent to UN, the ANC ?s current hypocrisy, and untenable situation is loud and clear, in their own words: Racial quotas in sport\""The moral position is absolutely clear. Human beings should not be willing partners in perpetuating a system of racial discrimination. Sportsmen have a special duty in this regard in that they should be first to insist that merit, and merit alone, be the criterion for selecting teams for representative sport. Indeed non-discrimination is such an essential part of true sportsmanship that many clubs and international bodies have express provisions to this effect. For example, the first fundamental principle of the Olympic Charter states: \""No discrimination is allowed against any country or person on grounds of race, religion or political affiliation\"". Not so in South Africa because both the sports administrators, who control all official sport, and the Government have jointly taken measures deliberately to exclude South Africa?s non-white people from participating in representative sport.\"" Obviously the same as above is true in modern day South Africa too, except the races are reversed. The self righteousness from the British authors continue: \""The official organisations are accorded international recognition and bear the responsibility for selecting representative teams for international competitions. There are no open trials to permit the selection of the best sportsmen in each class from the entire sporting community. Instead, competition is limited to whites only and it is from them that national teams are selected. This situation was well-known to all the international sports bodies which granted unqualified recognition to the racialist, official organisations in South Africa. Just as the South African white sports bodies are responsible for enforcing racial discrimination in domestic sport, so the international bodies which granted them membership are responsible for bestowing respectability upon such practices.\"" Once again, the whole world is aware of ANC?s racist sports quotas, but they choose to turn a blind eye, which makes a mockery of any self righteous \""anti-racism\"" claims any of them have made in their support of the ANC?s so called struggle (for power)? We therefor call upon all good people to raise their voices calling for the removal of quotas in sports and business and to please support this call for international sanctions against the ANC regime by sharing this and spreading the word! We would also welcome any contributions in this regard. ",sa-news,0
"The Red in The Rainbow Nation is Our Blood! Had The Gun Not Failed 3 Times, He Too Would Be Just Another White Killed For a Cellphone!","Architects of Apartheid: Time stood still for Le Roux Venter, a businessman in Bloemfontein, last Thursday when an armed black man pointed a firearm straight at his head, and callously pulled the trigger three times, luckily the firearm failed all three times. That saved his life. This is what Ramaphosa?s \""our people\"" do to the white minority in South Africa, they prey on us everyday, our lives mean nothing to them. Each and every day we see another incident in the media where a white person has been murdered, raped or beaten to a pulp by \""our people\"" for something as small as a cellphone. Everyday \""our people\"" prove beyond a reasonable doubt why we were never supposed to live with them, the \""architects of apartheid\"", as they have been referred to. The only result of us living with them will result in our slow painful genocide at their hands. We can see it right now. We just have to observe what is happening each and every day in South Africa. This is the rainbow South Africa, where the colour red in their rainbow nation represents the blood of the minority spilled by the ANC?s \""our people\"" everyday. In yet another attack by another gang of black males last Thursday, in Bloemfontein, Venter told Netwerk24 that he had to act quickly, after the gun had failed for the third time. He slapped the gun out of the attacker?s hand, but then another black attacker knocked him unconscious from behind with a hammer blow to the head. Venter said the incident began when builders came to him and told him there are 5 black men with guns in the yard of P&M Scrapyard, which is the business next to his own, Cred8 STEEL and Manufacturers. Venter said he moved in a careful way to investigate, but was met by one attacker with a firearm who took his cellphone, after which the attacker took a step back and callously pulled the trigger. Venter said he could hear a click but no shot went off. At that stage the attackers had already attacked two men working at P&M Scrapyard and beat them unconscious. They are Petrus van Zyl, the owner and Neels Bam, an employee. When Mr. Van Zyl regained his consciousness, he came to help Venter. Bam was still unconscious. The attackers fled with only R6,000 in cash and and three smartphones, something they would happily have killed for. The three men were helped by estate agents in the area who had a medical background. Venter sustained concussion and had to be hospitalised at Busamed to get stitches to his head wound. Neels Bam also had a big hole in his head and had to go for scans, while Petrus van Zyl also had a head wound but mainly had neck pain afterwards. Venter says he now lives in fear because he does not know if the attackers will come back. This is how most white people live in South Africa today, forever afraid of when \""our people\"" come with a panga, hammer, a knife, a gun or anything that can inflict hurt. This is the \""rainbow\"" nation the liberals of the world wanted and created, while they lulled us into a false sense of security with pretty pictures of rainbows? ",sa-news,0
Five (Black?) Men Gang Rape 89 Year Old Grandmother! Mainstream Refuses to Identify Race of Perpetrators! Are They Too Embarrassed?,"WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE OVER GENDER BASED VIOLENCE NOW? Why does liberal mainstream media not mention the race of the barbarians, when a frail, weak, elderly woman is attacked in her home and gang raped in South Africa? It happened again in Hertzogville on Thursday evening. Would it not make it easier to find and apprehend the rapists if we knew their race? Does mainstream media not want crimes to be solved? Or is it a case of once again mainstream media being overtly politically correct and drenched in Marxism?s phony \""critical race theory\"", which is taught to our kids at school and university, and which claims all whites are racist and guilty by default, and therefore deserve any crimes they become victims of? This is the essence of Black Lives Matter ? it is evil, genocidal, abhorrent and racist, and this is what mainstream media has become! Evil. In this case it is fairly stereotypical and we can safely assume that it was five black barbarians who raped an 89 year old white woman. It certainly is not the first time either, by far! However the race of the suspects and the victim are withheld by Netwerk24 in this report, and probably by SAPS too, which is the same practice followed by liberal media the world over in similar cases. But as soon as a white man does something, the race of the suspect is very pertinently mentioned, like in the case of George Floyd in America. But when a black man shoots and kills a 5 year old white boy, media does not mention the race! Now we see a report like this and see five \""men\"" have gang raped a 89 year old woman. Why does liberal media always do this? We know the suspects in this case are not white and the victim not black, because if they were, it would have been stated in bold in the headline of the report that it was white men. So by omitting the rapist?s race, the media are in fact admitting they are black! It would have been all over the news and TV stations and \""our people\"", as Ramaphosa calls his bantu, would have burnt a few towns down in revenge. Of course whoever commits a horrific crime like this would be a barbarian, but fact of the matter is that gangs of white men simply don?t roam around, break into the homes of elderly women and gang rape them. It is just not in our culture and psyche. Full stop. We are not the same and those that are tricked into thinking we are, put themselves and their loved ones at risk. In Fact SA-News has been challenging readers for over 6 years to cite similar cases where the races are reversed? we are still waiting. But yet we know that black men do it on a regular basis in South Africa, and increasingly in the West don?t we? And if you don?t know it, you have been living with your head in the sand in some dark pace somewhere. An 89 year old woman of Hertzogville, Free-State is now being treated in a Bloemfontein hospital after five black men gang raped her in her home on Thursday evening 3 September, 2020. The woman arrived back home around 18:00 and on arrival was overpowered by the five black men who were in her kitchen. According to Police spokesperson Montansi Makhele, the 5 (black) men grabbed her and dragged the woman to the bedroom where they ripped off her clothes. They then dragged her to the bathroom and gang raped her. The woman passed out during the violent rape and only regained consciousness on Friday morning after which she bravely phoned her daughter for help. A Police spokesman said the suspects entered the house through an open window. Why do people still allow their parents to stay alone in this hellhole called South Africa? ",sa-news,0
"Mandelas ANC Cuts Off Water from the Whole Southern Free State, Withholding a Basic Human Right! Another New Low!","This is the ANC, and it is ONLY the ANC. In typical communist fashion, where responsibility and accountability has been diffused, diluted and eternally scapegoated onto \""poverty\"", the ANC is both the creditor and the debtor! This action, which contravenes UN basic human rights, was taken as a punitive measure because an ANC controlled structure, the Kopanong municipality, which governs 9 towns in total, is in arrears with another ANC controlled structure, Bloemwater, despite a still existing lockdown for a pandemic, where the ANC itself said we need water more than ever to fight the pandemic! Kopanong municipality was also in the news two weeks ago for food parcels being stockpiled by councilors for own use and not being distributed! Yet still the people will vote ANC? Whichever way people want to spin this, it was the ANC which cut off the water to half a province and these criminals belong in one place only, and that is HELL, or failing that the International Criminal Court. This is the real ANC, it was the same ANC when Nelson Mandela led it, the same liars, the same thieves, the same black supremacist \""revolutionaries\"", they just disguised it better back then and where still learning the trick of state plunder! The taps of the Southern Free State ran dry on 13:00 on Wednesday this week, when Mandela?s ANC turned off the taps. The ANC controlled Bloemwater is refusing to provide water to hundreds of thousands of people unless Kopanong pays its debt of R450 Million. The towns in the Kopanong municipal area is Reddersburg, Gariepdam, Edenburg, Trompsburg , Bethulie, Springfontein, Jagersfontein, Fauresmith and Philippolis. The only available water in the area is from boreholes. At least one business chamber, the Gariep one, has threatened to approach the Bloemfontein High Court on an urgent basis to force Bloemwater to restore water to the people of the Southern Free State. Keep in mind, access to water is a basic human right according to UN, and is also guaranteed in South Africa?s Constitution. Bernard Phitsane, chairman of Bloemwater, told Netwerk24 that it is people?s right to go to court but all they want is the money they are owed. Guess they do not want to put their own controllers, the ANC, in a bad light. He did not deny that they are withholding water from people as a punitive measure, because ANC controlled municipalities owe them money. Phitsane also said that the Mangaung Metro owes Bloemwater R1, 2 Billion, Kopanong owes R450 million and the Mantsopa municipality ( Tweespruit, Exelsior and Ladybrand) owes between R2 million and R3 million. Keep in mind that normal residents in all these towns pay their bills, but they don?t control what happens to the money after it is paid over to ANC municipalities, which are supposed to pay Bloemwater. The Koponang Municipalities website does not even work, but you can be sure someone was paid handsomely for it? Parts of this community have been without water for the past FIVE years, because of mismanagement by an uncaring ANC. It is a gross human rights violation for people to live without water this long. Three years ago the DA requested the Water and Sanitation Portfolio Committee, to summon the Kopanong Municipality?s Mayor, Xolile Matwa, and Municipal Manager, Mr. M. Kubeka, to appear before the committee and account for the plight faced by Jagersfontein residents. ANC officials steal the money which is supposed to pay for services and this is how huge debts is racked up by the municipalities. This means old people in old age homes and patients in hospitals, nobody, has running water. Pls share so the whole world can know. ",sa-news,0
"What is a White Life Worth? R3,000? A Cellphone? Yet Saying K*ff*r Costs R200,000 or Comparing Blacks to Monkeys Costs R150,000!","Do White Lives Matter? Another white man was killed just for his cellphone and wallet, which he probably would have quite happily just handed over, making it a senseless deliberate killing. A judge fines a black man a mere R3,000 each for the negligent killing of two young white girls! George Floyd and Jacob Blake?s families got many millions of dollars when their black men died, while violently resisting arrest! Simply comparing blacks to monkeys, despite Homo Naledi apparently being their self proclaimed ancestor, cost Penny Sparrow R150,000 and her job, while Adam Catzavelos had to pay R200,000 for saying K*ff*r in Greece! Is SA \""law\"" just another black fascist weapon to fleece minorities? Johan Kriek (53) was stabbed to death during a home invasion attack by two black males on Tuesday morning in his house in Westville, Durban. The attackers entered the house when his wife opened the door to let the dogs out, before 05:00. Johan was stabbed in the chest and his 18 year old son was stabbed in his upper leg. The attackers fled with only a cellphone and a wallet. Paramedics tried to save Mr Kriek?s life but he passed away on the scene. Mr Kriek owned a towing truck business and was well loved because he always went the extra mile on vehicle accident scenes according to friends, who brought tribute to him on social media. People, we need to ask where is our weapons? We can?t fight against these attackers who have knives, pangas and guns with our bare hands. We need to arm ourselves or otherwise accept to be killed for small things like phones. Another man, husband and father is gone, and for what? A phone and a wallet. Do white lives matter? Another shocking travesty of justice was delivered last week by our incompetent court system when a taxi driver, Yibanathi Ndike, was only given an effective R6,000 fine by a Port Elizabeth court after he skipped a red traffic light in Kempston road, PE last year, with his taxi and collided with another car in which the young Michaela Victor (19) and Celine de Ridder (21) were traveling to work (they worked in the Atlas Security control room), killing the 2 girls. How can we have any confidence in courts that have delivered this and many other shocking verdicts, also that it is legal for the government to discriminate against white people on the basis of race in the lockdown period (with government assistance packages and food parcels ). Has the tyranny of the black majority become fascist and uncaring towards minorities? You be the judge. monkeys kaffirs ",sa-news,0
"Embattled Ramaphosa Uses Corruption in ANC to Save His Own Corrupt Position! Gangster ACE, NDZ & SACP Lose Round One!","Cyril Ramaphosa seems to have resorted to Mugabe type tactics, to save his own corrupt position, in the battle to oust him, after he announced that ANC members guilty of corruption, should resign from their posts, even as he himself has accusations against him. This ruling came after he got majority support in the National Executive Committee meeting over the weekend, and it appears to be aimed directly at those threatening to replace him. As a result, Ace Magashule is now due to appear before the ANC?s Integrity Committee, due to possible involvement in corruption, which is fueling speculation that Ramaphosa may have his eye on a new ANC Secretary-General. Ramaphosa?s strong actions are also seen as a victory over SACP / NDZ / COSATU aligned Secretary-General Ace Magashule, who initially said he would not resign from his post, if he was investigated for corruption. The remark is seen as a direct confrontation with the ANC?s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the power struggle between Magashule and Ramaphosa has now risen to a new level after the ANC?s Committee meeting this weekend. Opinion makers reckon Ramaphosa?s strongly worded ruling sends a strong message to corrupt ANC party members that might want to go against Ramaphosa. However, it is doubtful whether the Integrity Committee has the teeth to remove Ace, and can probably be interpreted as a method of creating the impression that there is action on corruption, whilst at the same time sending a warning to his enemies. Magashule is accused of being involved in millions of Rands of corruption, so Ramaphosa?s hand could be strong if Ace is convicted. Magashule requested a conversation with Ramaphosa hoping to provide an explanation about the remark, that he will not leave his post. This is the first step of a loser, which means the noisemakers in the SACP / Zuma camp are not as many as previously pretended. Despite this, the turmoil in the ANC is not likely to subside for some time, as the voices demanding the ANC president?s resignation are gathering pace and volume. The latest is an accusation brought against Cyril Ramaphosa that he himself is also guilty of corruption, by receiving the R500,000 that Bosasa paid into his account. According to reports, a senior member of the ANC?s National Executive Committee (NEC) has called directly for Ramaphosa to step down as president. The power struggle between Ramaphosa and the SACP / Zuma supporters is intensifying, but for now it appears Ramaphosa lives to fight another day, as he enjoys sufficient support among the ANC?s Executive Committee to continue the fight against the Zuma group, which is believed to be the most corrupt part of all. Unconfirmed reports suggest that Tony Yengeni is one of the members demanding Ramaphosa?s resignation, but Ramaphosa seems unfazed by such demands against him, knowing he has a majority in the NEC. In another ANC corruption scandal, the Special Investigation Unit will investigate Khusela Diko?s involvement in a corruption scandal involving millions of Rand. Diko, who was the official spokesperson for the presidency, is being investigated for her possible role in the scandal of protective equipment (PPE) in the Gauteng area. Diko resigned from her post after it came to light that she could be part of the scandal, but unconfirmed reports say Ramaphosa ordered her to vacate her post, which would indicate Ramaphosa?s willingness to use the axe. A spokesperson for the prosecutors and investigators has apparently already had a conversation with Diko?s husband and others who may have been involved in the corruption scandal involving R125 Million, which is seen by taxpayers in SA as the tip of a giant iceberg, and with the infighting at the ANC?s recent NEC meeting this weekend, many more incidents of corruption could come to light, as they are used in the battle for power and access to the Treasury.

Roll Call of Victims of Black on White Violence in SA! Crimes Which Mainstream Media Ignore Globally!,"#WhiteLivesDoNotMatter ? A white guy was attacked from behind with a brick yesterday, while the black attacker?s accomplices filmed it, and laughed as the white guy fell. They then tweeted out the video of the attack with the hashtag #WhiteLivesDoNotMatter, followed by BlackLivesMatter! While this hateful incident happened in the USA, it is nothing new in SA for blacks to be so callous, cruel and racist with their barbarity to the minority whites in SA. These are the monsters the Mainstream Media have created, and protect, and this report below is some of their victims this week. There is a pattern in these crimes which mainstream does their best to camouflage. Yet, imagine if this violence was committed by white people towards blacks in South Africa, the mainstream outrage would burn SA to the ground and it would be all over CNN and all other international TV networks in seconds! At the moment, we can?t even get South African TV stations and newspapers to report on all these brutal black-on-white murders and assaults. Even if such a report is made by liberal media, they make a point of not mentioning the race of the attackers. We know the bias and we know who owns TV stations and other liberal mainstream media outlets in South Africa, and the world, that preach BLM and subscribe to George Soros? Globalist Marxist Revolution, but ignore brutal black-on-white violence in South Africa and the West. Whilst liberal media pushes the black man good, white man bad narrative, the crimes should be mentioned somewhere, so here they are: Glen Glen & Vida Rafferty ? Glen (63) and Vida (60) Rafferty were executed in an apparent planned assassination hit on their farm at Normandien (KZN) around 22:00 on Saturday 29 August, 2020. They were shot on arrival after an evening out. Nothing of value was taken, so it was not a robbery. ? 5 black male attackers broke down the door of farmer Hilton Dowdall?s house, stabbed him to death and also tied up his wife on a farm at Summerveld, KZN on Thursday evening 27 August, 2020. The attackers fled with a TV, 2 cellphones and a firearm. Nick Bester Nick Bester ? Comrades marathon winner Nick Bester (60) was stalked from behind and brutally kicked, beaten with a stone in his face and whipped with his own revolver, whilst out hiking in the Magaliesberg mountains north of Pretoria on Sunday 30 August, 2020. The attackers forced Bester to give his bank card and pin and they even stripped him of his clothes. He was admitted to an ICU ward in hospital with headwounds, a broken cheek bone, three broken ribs and cuts and bruises all over his body. Liz Coetzee Liz Coetzee ? Liz Coetzee (68) and her house worker were brutally attacked on Thursday 27 August during a house robbery carried out by three black men in their house at Reitz in the Free State. Liz was strangled so hard that she almost passed out and her hands tied so tightly with cable ties that people struggled to get it off after the attack. The attackers also wrapped brown box tape over Liz?s mouth and eyes and also gagged, stabbed and beat her house worker with a hammer. The attackers ransacked the house whilst looking for valuables and left with what they could carry ? A home invasion took place on 28 August 2020, at 03:00, in Lakefield, Benoni, in Gauteng province. Three armed attackers invaded a home and sexually assaulted two female victims and cut a male victim with razor blades in the face. The attackers ransacked the home and fled with items including jewelry. (No other details could be found in media). ? A farm attack took place on 29 August 2020, at 21:00, in Gerhardsville, near Centurion, Pretoria, Gauteng. A man, Stan, went outside to investigate after the fence alarm was activated. He was shot by an attacker in the leg and pelvis. There were 3 black men involved in the attack. ? Sonja van der Merwe, her 19 year old daughter and three small sons were attacked by a group of seven panga wielding black men on a farm in the Hartbeespoort area, Gauteng on Wednesday evening 26 August around 18:00. It was one of 4 farm attacks in the area in 2 days, suspected to be the same panga wielding gang. Sonja and the children were detained and one attacker said he would chop Sonja?s finger off to get her ring, but luckily she got the ring off herself and handed it over. The group of attackers fled with the family?s car and left with various items, including jewelry, cellphones and a computer. The gang fled on foot after crashing Sonja?s Kia Sportage into the farm gate. ? Andre Marais (54) is lucky to be alive after he was shot 2 times in one leg, and 8 times in the other leg, during a farm attack by three black men on his farm in the Rysmierbult area in Potchefstroom, early on Tuesday evening 25 August, 2020. His main artery in his leg was also shot off. Andre?s worker was first overpowered in his house about 100 metres from the farm house and his worker screamed for help. Andre?s dogs began to bark and Andre went out with a firearm to investigate. He was shot outside and his firearm was taken by the 3 attackers. These are not the only attacks during the past week. What else waits in the following week? Please share so people could be more aware and informed of what is happening in South Africa. ",sa-news,0
Master Becomes Slave: Why is it Necessary for South Africa (RSA) to be Divided into Two Parts? The Two State Solution,"The Cape Is Still Afrikaans, But For How Long? Most of us probably know parts of the country?s history. From 1652, when the first Dutch landed in the Cape, until 2020, when most people did not even realize that the country was bankrupt, due to its infinite number of problems. One of the biggest problems, the \""Elephant in the Room\"", is OVERPOPULATION. Southern Africa is internationally regarded by experts as a dry subcontinent, and the RSA is even drier than the rest. Any sensible person will be able to tell you that blacks cannot reproduce indefinitely, as they please, without causing a humanitarian disaster. Then on top of that they add mismanagement, corruption and careless waste of resources! At some point, the South African population will have to apply a sharp brake, because the water supplies will dry up completely after 80 million inhabitants. A census survey has not been made in the country for a long time. We do not really know how many people there are in our country, because illegal immigrants stream into our country every day through open borders that seem deliberate. The growth among certain ethnic groups is also much more than the desired 2 to 3 children per family, but in a united state, such as the RSA, everyone suffers from OVERPOPULATION. It does not help if one ethnic group or province or one region tries to keep its population in check, while the rest of the country breeds like flies. In a second state, that country can make its own laws, and reduce births by improving quality of life. Immigration and emigration can then also be better controlled. The well-known Afrikaans historian of Stellenbosch, Professor Hermann Giliomee, writes in his book \""Die Afrikaners\"", that the importation of slaves began in 1658. There were too few Dutch workers in Table Bay to perform the enormous task. The Dutch?s employer, the VOC in Amsterdam, wanted to make Table Bay a \""halfway station\"". Because the journey from Amsterdam to the East Indies was too far to venture in one trip, a \""refreshment post\"" had to be created \""somewhere in between\"". Cape Town did not yet exist and there was not yet an established community with which the Dutch could trade; the local community was small groups of unsettled Strandlopers and other \""hottentot tribes\"" (nowadays called Khoi-Khoi and Khoi-San). They were too few, too nomadic and too unskilled to work as paid laborers for the VOC. The handful of Dutch workers wanted to go on strike because they were also too few, overworked, and not qualified for certain tasks. However the VOC (founded in 1602, which followed an extremely strict business etiquette), did not want to spend money on sending expensively trained employees from the Netherlands to Table Bay. Instead, they sent slaves to Table Bay, which was the first and biggest mistake of the VOC. Among the first slaves were blacks from Angola and present-day Benin. They were both poor countries on the West African coast. Later, slaves also came from Madagascar and Mozambique. Jan van Riebeeck?s term as commander at the Cape expired after 10 years. He and his wife, Maria de la Quelrie, left the Cape in 1662 after which the first population census was then conducted: There were 194 officials and subjects of the VOC, and 96 free burghers. Male = 57. Family members = 113. Slaves = 24. Free citizens = 36. Free family members = 37. Free slaves = 23. Gilliomee describes it as a FATEFUL DECISION of the VOC. It should never have happened! It was not in the nature of our ancestors to enslave fellow human beings, but even more slaves were imported. In the end, about 50% of all slaves came from Madagascar. The second largest group was from Indonesia, Ceylon, and India. In 1706 the numbers looked like this: Male officials = 542. Family members = 104. Slaves = 404. Male free burghers = 568. Free family members = 1 151. Free slaves = 901. The initial group of Dutch people was 90 people, of whom only 8 were women. Meanwhile, hundreds of ships sailed between Europe and Indonesia, bringing with them new immigrants. Most of the immigrants were unmarried young Germans who had served in the army in Europe. The longer Minority Groups in RSA refuse to establish their own country, the faster their numbers and representation will shrink, and Majority Groups? numbers will rise. A two-state solution will stop this trend. According to the 2011 census, the Northern Cape and Western Cape are the only two provinces where Afrikaans is the majority ? but for how long? Eastern Cape ? isiXhosa (78.8%), Afrikaans (10.6%) Free State ? Sesotho (64.2%), Afrikaans (12.7%) Gauteng ? isiZulu (19.8%), English (13.3%), Afrikaans (12.4%), Sesotho (11.6%) KwaZulu-Natal ? isiZulu (77.8%), English (13.2%) Limpopo ?

"Peaceful Fires? Liberal MSM Under Spotlight in a Post Truth World of Leftist Racebaiting Politics, To Spark a Socialist Revolution!","Mainstream Media (MSM) Twist Reality to Mimic Their Socialist Narrative. The Marxists predicted they would convince people not to believe what their own eyes are seeing. They promised to create a lost generation of obedient zombies. Well, that day has come! It is happening in America (and everywhere else in the Western world) today! Why is liberal mainstream media (MSM) so obviously biased and one-sided and why do they so visibly and obviously twist facts, strip words of any meaning, design and invent words to deceive and just plain out lie? Yet it is MSM that likes to accuse opponents of fake news, whilst they are the fake news! This is happening in South Africa too! This past weekend SA-News posted a video from the biker march in Cape Town, which was not shown anywhere on any mainstream media channel. The reason for their omitting and twisting of facts and words is basically to fabricate their reporting ? and words and ideas used ? into the framework of a progressive globalist narrative. Keeping the background of BLM?s violent riots in the USA in mind, it is clear that the narrative that the liberals in the media want to convey, is one of totally innocent black citizen victim, who are left powerless and killed in droves by racist white Police. Which cannot be further from the truth! Just like the lie that whites stole the land from blacks in SA, yet the mainstream perpetuate it every day, even though science, records and facts say otherwise. Julius Malema himself admitted blacks are not from South Africa! Liberal media and BLM then deliberately twist facts to suit their agenda after incidents of violent black suspects killed by police officers whilst resisting arrest. They imply that the black man is always totally innocent, the white officer always a monster. Facts are deliberately left out (like that not all policemen are white and that Police shoot white people in ever greater numbers). The narrative is deliberately engineered and fabricated, but why? Liberal media wants to convince the black population that they are permanent victims. This is when group think, which blacks and muslims are more susceptible to, take over and with that mob violence. As long as the media elite can convince people that they are victims, people?s right and ability to decide something for themselves will be taken away and group think and mob violence will take over. As long as the masses can be convinced that they are victims, they can be convinced that they need the help and guidance of the Elite, the Vanguard of the Proletariat, who has come to rescue them. Who is the Elite? What do they want? In short they want global Socialist Revolution, a New World Order and the creation of a borderless world. \""No borders\"" is by definition inherently white genocide, because whites will be bred out and assimilated within decades, as South Africans know all too well. They are anti white in nature and see the white people and their entire history as evil. That is also why terms like Cancel Culture and a Cultural Revolution is used to describe what is going on. Who is the people behind this.? Who is the Elite? The Elite is mostly firm believers in a progressive Globalist borderless world, which would include most business elite people controlling multi national companies, who believe a globalist world order would be in their best financial interest. Of course then you get the true ideological liberal, communist and socialist revolutionaries who have world supremacist fantasies too and have hopped onto world liberal politics, and forced it to the radical Left by providing multinational globalists with nation destroying weapons, like LGBT, \""anti-racism\"", abortion, internationalism, mass immigration, global warming, etc. with which to corrupt the fabric of our societies. The undisputed chief financier behind all this is George Soros and his Open Society Foundation who has donated almost $18 Billion dollars to the cause of destroying Nation States through social unrest and deviancy. Soros drives far Leftist and radical political causes like Defund Police, funds the campaigns of Leftist Attorney Generals in the USA, with the aim to take many types of crimes off the statue books , de-criminalyze illegal immigration, etc. The coalition behind the Liberal/Globalist revolution is varied and BLM and Antifa are used as toy soldiers, hence the need to whip them up into a frenzy to spark violence, to spark the revolution. In typical Bolshevik/Marxist style actually. Nothing peaceful about it ? in fact they know full well, from their evil history, that they have to incite the far right to action, otherwise they would not exist! When inevitable violence then rage out of control, the liberal mainstream media then start with a deliberately designed narrative to paint the riots as \""mostly peaceful\"". A narrative is created to protect the end goal of the uprising which is the Globalist revolution because if people are going to stand up against BLM, Globalist and Antifa violence, the Globalist Revolution could be hampered. The Liberal/Globalist Alliance besides BLM and Antifa includes the likes of the American Democratic Party and strangely enough Islamist groups like CAIR and Muslim Brotherhood, which are anything but liberal in ideology, but have forged an alliance with the Liberal/Globalist/Socialist Alliance to conquer the West and white nations in general, as they have always wanted. And so liberal media tells the public that there is no violence, yet there is violence, extreme violence going on. Simply put the revolutionary forces will use every opportunity they get to stoke the revolution and the violence they need to further their revolution. They are primed and ready for outrage and are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to come along, events that can put a spark to already whipped up masses, then they latch onto that opportunity. Since the George Floyd incident, and many before, going back decades, we have seen how the Globalist forces have sought to use incidents of Police shootings as the spark they need, even though these so called victims were violent drug crazed criminals who opposed and resisted the Police as much they could before being shot by the Police. It happened with the George Floyd incident and now again with the shooting and killing of another black man, Jacob Blake, in Wisconsin, USA last Sunday. This article is not to discus the individual cases but the bigger picture behind it all and the motive liberal mainstream media has to created a false narrative. It can shortly be mentioned that Blake resisted Police and went for a knife and got into a car, not his, with three kids in it! Police had to protect the kids in case he did harm to them or used them as hostages or kidnapped them. As with the George Floyd incident, pre programmed violent protests by BLM mobs erupted afterwards, and as with the George Floyd incident, liberal mainstream media already had the narrative set before any facts were examined. They were determined to paint Blake as yet another innocent black victim. Some of the media headlines afterwards would be funny were it not done to maintain a narrative to aid in the evil Liberal/Globalist world revolution, which is after all aimed to remove all borders and to create a political correct dystopian world, devoid of identity. Identity is something which the Liberals and elitists hate. A headline in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel read: \""Jacob Blake had knife in car but was otherwise unarmed\"". Kenosha, Wisconsin was the most affected after the Blake incident by arson, looting and violence. Yet mainstream media did it?s best to paint the violence as \""mostly peaceful\"", a term widely used to twist and hide the truth and facts. Whilst CNN was reporting from the Kenosha violence, with burning cars in the background, the headline read: \""Fiery but mostly peaceful protests after Police shooting\"". CNN also changed the blurb on the bottom of the screen, while the reporter was reporting, to remove the word \""violence\"" from the description. Literally editing reality live! Earlier in the year ABC TV in America had this line whilst BLM riots and violence erupted : \""Peaceful demonstration intensifies\"" . This particular demonstration was so peaceful that buildings started to burn by themselves! Wow! Not really. The mobs set them ablaze, yet the media still called the riots \""mostly peaceful\"". In short, liberal mainstream media don?t want to report anything that harms the political cause of their Masters, the Elite. They are not reporters anymore, they are political activists. People should always remember that not all is lost however. People should not see themselves as without will and as marionettes that can be twisted around on a string. With new technology, social media and the internet we see the rise of alternative media like Breitbart and SA-News and voices using blogs and podcasts, community radio etc. to tell the truth and stand up for their rights and believes. The obvious thing to do would be to simply ditch liberal mainstream media and instead use and support and share these alternative resources. People should realise that MSM media does not have the exclusive right to opinion forming anymore. The media elite wants to force us in a specific direction, and to control what people think and what we believe. We think they have the power, but they do not, we the people have the power to collapse them by using alternative media, social media and the internet. The media elite only retain their power over us because we make use of them, so let us stop that and free ourselves from them as soon as possible. Take the \""Red Pill\""? ",sa-news,0
VIDEO: SAPS Block Biker Protest to Parliament! Pull Biker Off His Bike When He Breaches Their Barricade & Fire Thunderflashes!,"SAPS in Cape Town barricaded the road to the Parliament, to prevent the \""Bikers Against Farm Murders and Racism\"" march from reaching Parliament. When one of the bikers breached this barricade, they violently pulled him off his bike which fell over. The biker defended himself, punching at the SAPS official, and other bikers came to his defense. Thunderflashes were then fired off to quell the scuffle. Peaceful rallies took place all over #SouthAfrica by the \""Bikers Against Farm Murders & Racism\"" with reports of as amany as 30,000 bikes across SA with other reports of 41,000 bikes through toll gates! While events went smoothly in #Pretoria, #Durban, #Limpopo, #NMB, that was NOT the case in Cape Town where the national police service, #SAPS, aggressively intervened. Apparently 15 people have been arrested. If video does not load above, watch here: https://youtu.be/rYGiku04X00 ",sa-news,0
VIDEO: Land Grabber by Day and Farm Murderer by Night? Land Occupier (Zimbabwean?) Threatens Farmer They Will Kill Him!,"We wonder how many farm murders would be solved if SAPS took all the land and farm occupiers? fingerprints, to compare with those farm attack evidence records? Or try running them through the Zimbabwean police database? As we see in the video, which was taken in Nelspruit, the instigator of the farm occupiers, is very confident and it is clear from this arrogant instigator?s threats, that there is a link between farm occupiers and farm attacks and murders. The instigator is also clearly not a Southern African ? his skin is very dark and he could not even understand the black language that the Boer used ,with the other landgrabbers, who had pangas at the ready. How do the Zimbabweans benefit from inciting and committing farm attacks? Unless they are paid for it directly? The incident took place in Nelspruit near Karino yesterday. Neither Witrvier nor Nelspruit SAPS wanted to open cases against the land occupiers. The land grabbers also threatened the Farmer in front of the police, that they were going to kill him in the evening!

#BlackWar: SA Swamp is Rigging & Facilitating Black Violence Aimed at Decimating & Assimilating Conservative Minorities  Just Like BLM!,"Society Captured: South Africa?s civil service and establishment, including the courts, police, mainstream media, government and municipal structures, have been captured and are rigged. The System has been deliberately populated with liberals, ANC cadres, communists and left wing globalists, intent on promoting criminality, illegality, victimhood, a culture of entitlement and free stuff, hypocrisy, political correctness, violence and the self righteous justification of the smash and grab culture and of expropriation without compensation. All of this to enforce the constant mainstream narrative that white man is bad and black man is good. This can all appear very confusing, but at the end of the day, the BLM violence and constant so called \""Service Delivery Protest\"" violence in SA, have the same sponsors and roots and the same modus operandi. Everyday now we see burning, looting and the violent destruction of property and infrastructure by blacks in South Africa. Interestingly, we are starting to see the same type of perpetual systemic mindless violence by BLM mobs in places like America and Europe, which goes beyond it just being an election year in USA, but is symptomatic of the Africanisation of the West. The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the dismantling of Apartheid, were just an experiment to perfect what is taking place in the West today! We have become so used to it, it is like a feature of South African society, like boerewors and rugby. The captured mainstream media deliberately call it \""service delivery protests\"" to legitimise it, even though the rioters are destroying their own clinics, libraries, schools, municipal offices, transport buses, trains, substations, and even attack fire trucks dispatched to help when a fire breaks out. So clearly \""service delivery\"" is the last thing on their little brainwashed minds? Nobody is ever arrested and successfully convicted for this mindless violence, and so it carries on with impunity, which proves the authorities are in on it. Coupled with these so called \""service delivery protests\"" we are entering the phase of Zimbabwean style land grabs with mobs of land invaders taking open land wherever they want, and scammers are even springing up selling blocks of land for R250 with impunity. The land grabbers nowadays come with earth moving equipment, level the ground and then organizers sell plots to the local black population, indicating the presence of organized for-profit syndicates, yet the law is seldomly upheld, and in this way new permanent squatter camps rise up all over the show, many a time next to highways, clearly with the establishments approval. We all know this right? But what is the bigger picture behind this? Far Left Wing instigator NGOs like Bertha Foundation for example, founded by billionaire Tony Tabatznik, a Jew who fled the Rainbow South Africa he helped create, with his family to London, instigate an \""uprising\"" through informal networks and secret groups. They then sponsor left wing activist/journalists to write articles about these \""protests\"", through Groundup, also funded by Soros, who funds BLM, and other left wing provocateurs. These articles are then placed in mainstream media platforms, giving legitimacy to their artificially created \""protest\"". Even News24 promotes these lefty GroundUp articles on their news platforms. Yes, antifa is alive and active in South Africa! There are dozens of these globalist NGOs active in SA, aggressively attacking conservative groups and militarizing moderate Africans, just like the ANC did in the early 1990?s, when they burnt nearly 1,000 of their own black people alive, with Winnie mandela?s matches and tires (necklacing). You can recognise evil world supremacist communists by their modus operandi. If they are willing to burn humans alive, what other evil are they capable of? The bigger picture behind this is African culture, the promotion of their own at the expense of others (black supremacy), their self justification to take and conquer with sheer numbers. To assimilate and consume everything is the #AfricanWay. This African Way is perfect for the Globalist provocateurs to harness and use as cannon fodder in their campaign for world supremacy and totalitarian rule. We are talking about more than random occurrences, this is ethnic warfare spread out over time, a long established way of life and conquest to dominate and take everything they want, just as they have been doing for 2,000 years ever since they left Nigeria, and started colonising and plundering the entire sub-Saharan Africa. Now they have been told by the globalist left that they are victims and thus entitled to take everything they see! To them this is just a new weapon to continue their conquest, consumption, assimilation and breeding. To us, this is the proxy #BlackWar. This is a societal reality, the practitioners are sponsored and pushed by liberals who believe they are do-gooders and hard Left black supremacists, like the ANC and the EFF who know exactly what they are doing. The ANC?s National Democratic Revolution policy framework (NDR), also directs that all influential positions in society, including judges, should be filled by ANC cadres and sympathizers, so that their ideology can be implemented across the board. Through publishing houses like the Cape Times, Argus and Star being owned by left wing groups and even state operators, mainstream media is completely captured by liberal ideology, which at the moment is aimed at creating a globalist world without borders. This Liberal/Globalist Alliance is very anti white in nature and is not above justifying violence like that used by BLM and Antifa, and indeed burning people alive, is not foreign to them! Since the early 1990?s the radicalisation and violence has being impregnated as a working belief system, which is being implemented right across the spectrum of black society, whether it is used by taxi bosses to achieve monetary objectives or black unions \""negotiating\"" better wages. Young black men see ANC cadres getting rich from corruption after having instigated violent action locally, to make a name for themselves, with the complicit media helping. It is now the recruitment ground for the ANC and EFF. Violence defines the ANC and EFF. #BlackWar is now everywhere, it is not hard to find a farm or home invasion attack where the most inhumane violence and torture methods are used to take cash and guns, but also to intimidate white farmers to leave their land. Communists hate farmers because communist regimes like to use food to control the citizens, so farmers stand in their way of ultimate control. A case study in #BlackWar is to be found in the Western Cape which is majority populated by brown (Khoisan descendants) and white people, but where a deliberate socially engineered black Xhosa population invasion has been taking place, from the Transkei and Eastern Cape to the Western Cape. This is not a mere natural movement of people, this is #BlackWar illustrated. There is a specific pattern and there is a clear organizational structure behind it, probably local ANC and EFF leaders guided and funded by globalist provocateurs. It is a prime example of how socialist policies like providing child grants, but no jobs, have caused a population explosion amongst the black population to the detriment of brown and white minorities, who are facing a total wipe-out in the long term. In short #BlackWar goes like this: Massive numbers of invaders would enter open land in the targeted region, many times near highways or on nature conservation land and set up plots. Of course there are no services like water and electricity, so in no time the squatters will start to employ a deliberate campaign of violence, like stoning cars and trucks on the roads, burning tires, even placing human excrement in the road, to force authorities to give them free houses, water and electricity. Afraid of more violence, the City of Cape Town complies and this just renews the cycle. In no time we will see that the black African Xhosa population will be the majority in the WC and so a deliberate campaign of violence or #BlackWar is used to achieve ethnic dominance, including over jobs and business opportunities in the area (because of the setting of national demographic racial quotas in the workplace by the national ANC government). This is nothing else than ethnic cleansing, dominance and hegemony, the tyranny of the majority. Communism. But because liberals in the media see black people as permanently disadvantaged, they fight to undermine the law enforcement structures of the City of Cape Town, which is fighting a losing battle against violence and barbarism. Like is happening with the Defund Police anarchists in USA. The Western Cape High Court has just made a ruling that land owners can not protect property and remove illegally erected structures without a court order. The application was brought by the EFF and Human Rights Commission. The City will appeal the ruling. If this Western Cape High Court ruling becomes permanent law, efforts by property owners to protect land belonging to them will be totally impossible. On August 17 the Daily Maverick online website, which is known to dress itself in a morally righteous PC cloak all the time, slammed the City of Cape Town for trying to oppose land invasions which is mostly done near to highways, nature reserves and wetlands or areas slated for development of houses and services. To put it mildly the article made the City of Cape Town out as the bad guy and the land invaders, led by ANC bigwigs and syndicates, as the poor oppressed. This is the typical useful idiot approach liberals have became famous for. For the sake of proving that #BlackWar is not that innocent, and give an indication of what damage it can cause, the following examples are provided: ? 14 August 2020 ? Nduli township, Ceres It is #TheAfricanWay to burn down your own library because you don?t get free houses and other free things fast enough. Residents of Nduli in Ceres burnt down the Nduli library on Friday morning in ongoing violence, burning and looting since Tuesday in the township. On Tuesday Nduli residents started to block roads with burning tyres. A municipal truck and truck transporting produce from the fruit and vegetable farm Laastedrif was set alight on Wednesday evening. Motorists who wanted to make use of the R46 road were also pelted with stones. The municipality said the library was partially burnt out and computers were stolen. The violence is aimed at forcing the municipality to give all the houses in the new Vredebes housing development to Nduli residents. People should know one thing and that is that the #BlackWar violence won?t ever stop because people see that barbarian behaviour and violence is rewarded. The demands are also likely to just increase because it is better to get free stuff than to work for it. ? 25 August 2020, Witsand, Atlantis #BlackWar erupted again on Tuesday morning 25 August in Witsand, Atlantis, Cape Town when a rent-a-crowd acting on behalf of taxi owners stoned six Sibanye buses belonging to the Golden Arrow company. Several passengers and a bus driver were injured and had to be taken to a local hospital. Golden Arrow says the terrorist attack was executed on behalf of taxi bosses who don?t want Golden Arrow to provide a service in the area. #BlackWar #TheAfricanWay is continuing in Cape Town where land invaders have set another two Golden Arrow passenger buses alight early Monday morning a week ago. Three Golden Arrow buses were also burnt out by the invaders the previous Friday morning. A spokesperson for Golden Arrow told Netwerk24 that one bus cost R2, 4 Million. Trains are only running on the southern line in Cape Town as most trains have been deliberately set alight over the years and overhead electric cables for railway lines were looted. Destruction of your own infrastructure is clearly #TheAfricanWay. Several business premises in the Kraaifontein area were also violently attacked and invaded by land invaders who grabbed nearby land recently. ? 6 August, 2020 ? Bloekombos, Kraaifontein RACIST AND HOOLIGAN RIOTERS ALMOST KILL YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR CREATING JOBS FOR PEOPLE FROM THE SAME AREA A young man who has just created a company a month ago and bought a bakkie through the bank, Michael du Plessis (21), his foreman Pierre and some of his workers were attacked and had they not managed to make a getaway, would have been probably murdered by a rioting barbarian mob in Bloekombos, Kraaifontein on Thursday afternoon. Du Plessis was entering the area to drop off workers and did not know there was a riot in the area. His bakkie was suddenly surrounded by the mob and attacked, despite the mob doing nothing to a taxi which also just entered the area. Stones and bottles rained on the bakkie and windows were thrown out. A big concrete block also hit the driver?s door. A concrete block came through the passenger window, and hit Michael in the face. Blood streamed down his face and he could not feel his face. They had to make a U-turn to drive through the crowd to safety to save their lives. They made it to safety but the new bakkie is now severely damaged. Michael and some of his workers needed medical treatment afterwards. People should ask themselves the question, what sort of barbarian would want to kill someone who they don?t even know, a job creator who came to drop workers who stay in the same area, all in an attempt to take out their anger because the the commie left promised them free houses and free everything. This was clearly terror and attempted murder and make no mistake, these riots are planned by the ANC and EFF in the province to conquer the WC and \""transform\"" it into another black ruled sh*thole.

"Cemetery Flooded With Raw Sewage for a Year! Too Dangerous to Visit Deceased Relatives, but Still Being Stripped by Robbers!","#MangaungShithole ? F.W. De Klerk?s Rainbow AbomiNation somehow always finds a way to reach new depths of disgusting disrespect and malevolent negligence. Now even our dearly departed are no longer sacred or safe from #TheAfricanWay! Where is the dignity the surrender constitution guarantees Frikkie? Even the resting places of our dead are being turned into sh*tholes, literally! This daily abuse, decay and rot is not the picture that FW de Klerk and the liberals promised would happen, but this picture is the only reality Africa ever offers. Civilisation is simply not possible. Everything has been taken from us in the so called rainbow South Africa, we have nothing that is dear to us left. We don?t even have proper places to bury our dead anymore, including those tens of thousands of white people, especially the elderly, who were callously murdered by \""our people\"" as black politicians refer to black Africans. The Memoriam cemetery in Bloemfontein has been flooded with raw sewage for more than a year, because of a total lack of maintenance by the municipality. In addition, vandals have started to carry away tombstones and memorial plaques. Heaven knows what the vandals want to do with it, but in Africa nothing lasts. In Africa nothing exists that is immune to theft. Adriaan de Bruyn, a VF+ Councillor in the Bloemfontein municipality, told Maroela Media that raw sewage has been flowing into the cemetery since before August 2019. De Bruyn says thousands of litres of raw sewage is spilling between the railway line and the cemetery everyday, and it spills over into the cemetery. Some of the graves have even begun to sink into the ground as a result. The raw sewage also lands in a stormwater canal running through the cemetery. Mr De Bruyn says there is a blockage in the main sewage pipe which does not get fixed by the municipality, and the blockage causes the raw sewage of at least 3 neighborhoods to spill into the cemetery. Mr De Bruyn says in addition to the sewage spill, vandals are also breaking and stealing tomb stones and the walls of remembrance. There is no access control or policing and anyone can come and go as they please. Nicole Viljoen, a Bloemfontein resident and Radio Rosestad presenter, says the condition of the cemetery is shocking. She says her great grandmother is buried there, but she could not visit her grave for 3 years now because it is not safe to go there. She says Memoriam was once the most beautiful cemetery in Bloemfontein. This is the respect that the black ANC rulers have for our dead and our still alive family, and it will never change. The minorities have very little left to be proud of, or to call their own. We are not even allowed to maintain or build something of our own, because then it is called racist. But we do not want what black african rule is offering, because rot and decay is the only thing they can achieve. The marxists did promise us, they would would dig up our dead white men, and kill them again? However, these black politicians should be very wary, because the day we have nothing left to lose, is the day we become the most dangerous? ",sa-news,0
"Is EVERYTHING The ANC Does a Scheme To Plunder from Taxpayers & \""Redistribute Wealth\"", to Buy Votes, To Keep Power, To Keep Plundering?","ANC TROJAN HORSE ENTERPRISES: R52 Million of taxpayers money has been wasted on yet another failed Collective (communist) chicken farm in Virginia, Free State this time! But was it ever intended to produce chickens, or was it just another ANC Trojan Horse Enterprise, designed to fail, to facilitate \""legally\"" stealing money from the taxpayer, while pretending to be a BBBEE business venture ? a \""perfect crime\""? The ANC?s approach to establish collective BBBEE farms, with massive amounts of taxpayer money, is well known and it is just as well known that these grandiose projects end in massive \""failure\"" every time, almost as if it was planned to fail, with cadres plundering during every step of the short but costly life cycle of the doomed project? The ANC?s Rainbow Nation is full of examples of this, not all as massive as the Gupta?s infamous Estina Vrede dairy farm where hundreds of Millions of Rands in taxpayer money landed in Gupta and cadre pockets. The Zebediela citrus farm in Limpopo is another example. It is almost certain that if the Zondo or some other independent commission were to go through all of the ANC regime?s \""projects\"" since 1994, from the Trojan Horse perspective, it would be stunned to find deliberate, systemic, institutional and structural looting of the state. These ventures are always operated on a collective basis (to diffuse accountability and blame). The ANC government selects a group of people who \""own\"" and runs the farm. The old adage always remains true, that as soon as a group owns something, nobody is in charge and nobody takes responsibility. This is what communists could never understand, or is that what they want ? no accountability? Could this be the reason ALL communist socialist states fail, due to corruption, cronyism and elitism with no one being responsible, meaning it is too easy to plunder, with no punishment? SA is sitting with a situation where thousands of farms are given to selected black people (ANC voters), by the ANC government and because it fails and gets sold, back to whites invariably, by the new black \""owners\"", most of the time these BEE farming projects don?t even get counted as black farms in the end, so the government keeps on blaming whites as having too much land, and then Land Expropriation without Compensation (EWC) is given as the solution for the problem. A perfect crime scheme for communists. The same problem is evident in other sectors of the economy too, where selected black people get shares in companies for free, then sell the shares, which means the government must empower other selected black people / ANC cadres. It creates an endless cycle of permanent \""empowerment consumption.\"" Africa has always been about hand to mouth, day to day, subsistence consumption and not about building for the future! Hence the comparison is often made to locusts, who would even eat the seeds meant for the next crop. NDZ Net Worth But the ANC regime never mentions how many farms they have provided for free to black people / ANC cadres, and how many of these farms failed or how many cronies received farms, Mugabe style. The Daily Dispatch reported in 2018 that only 26 of 265 farms that were given to black farmers in the Eastern Cape at a value of R1, 4 Billion, were still viable, whilst the rest were in a state of dereliction. That is less than 10%! This corruption can be found right across South Africa. Construction on the Virginia Mega Poultry project in the Free State was begun in 2015 and the project was supposed to be fully operational in 2017. The five big chicken sheds were supposed to house 40,000 chickens and it was intended to benefit 17 beneficiaries. Another question is how are these beneficiaries chosen? What is the criteria? By whom? The only thing that is certain is the collectivist communist approach which can never work, well, not as a business anyway ? but as a means to plunder however, it works very well! Roy Jankielsohn of the DA in the Free State has now said that there is today almost no visible activity at the chicken farm which cost the taxpayers so much to build. Jankielsohn said that the problems were already visible in 2018 when Parliament?s National Council of Provinces (NRP) visited there. Back in 2018 already the chickens kept on dying en masse, also the story of many a BEE chicken farm in South Africa. This is not only a story of the failure of B.E.E. farming in South Africa, it is a matter of animal abuse because these farms mostly end up atrociously filthy, and end up in endless suffering for the poor animals before they succumb and die. We cannot only look at this in the sense of a political failure, we have to look at this in the light of ethics and our responsibility as humans to conduct farming in a humane manner.

"Whites Being Brutally Murdered Allegedly for Phones While BLM & Left Wing Establishment Ignore it, Demanding the Shrinking White Minority Kneel!","#WhiteVictimsMatter ? People prefer to hear \""nice\"" lies rather than the blunt and blatant truth, which is that the white minority in South Africa are under heavy attack and siege. We are being murdered, robbed, maimed, tortured, raped, beaten to a pulp, oppressed and fleeced in the most barbarian of ways, left, right and centre. This of course is in addition to the mind numbing elevation and worship of BLM, even while we are being subjected to a race based economic murder program (BBBEE) aimed against the white minority, by a black supremacist ANC government, which intensified during the lockdown, when businesses were closed for a prolonged period, and then white people were refused any sort of financial assistance in the time of a pandemic, that knows no colour. Due to race based BBBEE laws, most white people are forced to rely on small businesses in the informal sector to survive, and many white people were left without an income for months as a result of the extended lockdown, leaving many of these businesses bankrupt. This is no secret however. If it is news to you, you have been following the liberal, BLM agenda setting media, that deliberately and willfully ignore white victims in South Africa. Never forget that most of the victims of this wanton killing spree of the minority, to take small things like phones, are simple and poor working men and women who try to eek out a living under a hostile racially driven regime, amid a draconian pandemic ? these extremely brutal attacks are committed by people who are almost exclusively black ? but we are not allowed by liberal Big Tech to say which colour, because then we will be attacked, castigated, censored and blocked from using social media, but you know what we mean. It seems that we as simple white minority men, women and children are not important to liberal media and our lives are unimportant, and worth only a phone or a few Rands to the killers ? whose colour we may not mention, but are from the race group on whose behalf Soros and his Globalist Alliance claim to be waging a political/revolutionary offensive, under the trojan horse BLM banner, to take control of the world. Influenced by liberal media and unable to look the truth in the eye, because it?s easier to keep the eye \""nice\"" untruths and on trivialities and kneeling sportsmen and women, appearing on pay content TV channels, owned by filthy rich liberals, most white people prefer to ignore the brutal and constant attack on the white minority of South Africa. Paying attention to it will demand action, which is something many are not prepared or willing to do, so it is easier to keep your head in the sand. But just remember as more and more innocent and law abiding white people are being slain, for phones or a few bucks, the monster is being fed and fed and the chance that you will become a white victim, at your front door is getting better and better. In all likelihood in the event you become a victim, you would want people to talk about the attack on you, or come to visit you in hospital or attend your funeral, so stop ignoring what is happening and start talking about it now and implement measures for self protection. Don?t think generalizations of talking about a crime problem in general will help you either. The stokers of the fires of hate against the minority, that sit as the looting government of the day, wont fix anything and neither black crimes or white victims will matter. We are seeing an ethnic war being waged against a minority in South Africa and that war is being waged everyday, just look around you. Almost every white family knows somebody whose life was taken by people of a certain race group, but whose race we are not allowed to mention. But we are asking why now? We are asking do #WhiteLivesMatter? The following attacks happened just the last couple of days alone. For people who don?t know South Africa, please keep in mind that tens of thousands of white people have been murdered by criminals coming from a certain race group, which we are not allowed to mention, ever since the ANC took control of the country in similar incidents in 1994. ? Charlotte Freeman (46), a mother and grandmother, is today everything but free, and is without a home . She is traumatized and too afraid to go back to the smallholding where her life partner was shot to death, in a home invasion in the early morning hours of Thursday, 20 August, 2020. Werner de Bruin (33) was shot dead through a glass front door, and for only two phones, because that is all that the three black terrorist assassins took. Werner and Charlotte lived in a 2 bedroom house on the smallholding in the Mooiplaats, Boshkop area east of Pretoria . They both worked for the owner Dr. Ockert Botha, a veterinarian and businessman. Charlotte told Netwerk24 that Werner died a hero because he tried to protect his family by slamming the Trellidor shut to protect his family. The couple?s 2 year old son and Charlotte?s grandson, from a previous relationship, were in the house at the time of the attack. She has not yet managed to tell the 2 year old that his Dad is dead. Charlotte described Werner as a soft hearted, loving and caring partner who was always very helpful to everyone. ?

He was also repeatedly stabbed with a knife in his arm and head. The attackers abducted his wife in the couple?s vehicle, and sat on her head whilst they drove away. It is unknown what they planned to do with her, but the attackers became aware that local safety structures had picked up the vehicle, and they abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot into Khayamandi.

Potlaki was out on bail after a home invasion attack on another farm in the area, in November last year. Hennie was a crucial witness in that case. Potlaki forced some farm workers to phone Hennie to pretend something is wrong so he could come out of the house. Potlaki them ambushed Hennie whilst he was with his 2 year old daughter Nina, and her 10 year old nephew and shot him right through his upper body. The bullet went through Hennie?s spleen which had to be removed during an emergency operation after the incident. Luckily Hennie had his firearm with him and Potlaki was killed when Hennie returned fire. Hennie is alive, but it is a true miracle that he is still with his family and he survived mostly because he was armed. Incidents like these are likely to increase in intensity. The only way to try and stop it is to prepare adequate safety measures and reveal the extent of this slow war against the white minority to the whole world. ",sa-news,0
"Adults Only Film Starring Children? Netflix Apologises for Sexualised Promo Featuring Children Twerking but Refuses to Remove \""Disgusting\"" Film!","If ever there was a time to vote by unsubscribing, this is it! The online streaming service, Netflix, who have Barack Obama as an advisor, was forced to apologize for a suggestive promo featuring twerking 11-year-old girls, that was even BANNED ON 4CHAN! The streaming service removed the US promo poster for the French film Mignonnes (\""Cuties\"") after a Social Media outcry. This is the THIRD time Netflix has had to backtrack on material sexualising children, and is now under mounting pressure to cancel its upcoming release of the indecent film, after a petition demanding its removal has already garnered more than 570,000 signatures. Pedophilia might be fine for muslims and socialists, but it is not for Western christian audiences! The film, named Cuties, is a French film where a Senagalese Muslim migrant girl from a \""traditional\"" family, who joins a dance group called Mignonnes, which is also the French name of the film. However, the film immediately faced a backlash, with critics accusing it of sexualizing children, particularly through the act of \""twerking.\"" This movie is almost certainly an attack on our christian values and western way of life. \""This movie/show is disgusting as it sexualizes an ELEVEN-year-old for the viewing pleasure of pedophiles and also negatively influences our children!\"" reads the petition on the Change. org website. \""There is no need for this kind of content in that age group, especially when sex trafficking and pedophilia are so rampant! There is no excuse, this is dangerous content!\"" The subscription service said in a statement on Thursday that it was \""deeply sorry for the inappropriate artwork that we used for Cuties,\"" acknowledging that the design ? which featured the film?s 11-year-old children in crop tops and booty shorts, several seemingly mid-twerk ? was neither \""OK\"" nor representative of the film itself. The offending poster was replaced with an image of the main character wearing a bit more clothing (though still wearing the same suggestive expression). The original French poster is significantly more deceitful though, innocent-looking, showing the girls jubilantly waving bags after a shopping spree, but they?re still sporting lingerie, worn on the outside. The company also changed the film?s description, politicizing it with euphemisms to attack the conservative hordes of social media users accusing them of baiting and encouraging pedophilia. The initial summary, which read \""Amy, 11, becomes fascinated with a twerking dance crew. Hoping to join them, she starts to explore her femininity, defying her family?s traditions,\"" became \""11-year-old Amy starts to rebel against her conservative family?s traditions when she becomes fascinated with a free-spirited dance crew.\"" However, the company declined to elaborate on why it had settled on such an overtly sexualized image. Interviews with the film?s director Maïmouna Doucuré suggest a hasty cover up as her explanations are very different from the promoting of twerking children, Netflix?s poster advertises. The image had sparked a firestorm on social media, with users calling it ? and Netflix ? \""disgusting\"" and demanding to know how such filth had gotten past management. One user contacted Netflix?s Customer Service and was shocked to find Netflix?s official line seems to preclude denouncing pedophilia! Fortunately she took a screenshot: ",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: \""Blacks Are Not From South Africa!\""  Malema Finally Admits The Truth About Bantu Migration & Black Colonisation of Southern Africa!","The establishment mainstream media and ANC/EFF/BLF lie that whites \""stole\"" land from blacks in SA has been totally debunked by the EFF leader Julius Malema himself, when he admitted on a public platform to his followers, that blacks (bantu/ nguni / n e g r o), are colonists and settlers from the North. This is a very important and fundamental fact because the entire motivation and coercion of whites handing over their country, to the black migrants from the North, with the added threat of mandela?s bombs, was based on this lie which became the mainstream narrative. It was used constantly to create and manufacture white guilt, which was used to trick white South Africans into giving away the first world country, that their forefathers had built over the centuries!

"Two-State Solution: Blacks and Whites Have Been Incompatible for Centuries, Forced Integration Without Borders Will Obviously Lead to Violence!","Compared to our motherlands in Europe, South Africa is a young country and the history of our own nation began only in the year 1652, with a prehistory of the Portuguese period from the 1400?s. But, despite our short history, it was a period full of sensational events, all of which cannot be described in detail here. The fact that blacks and whites are \""baring their teeth\"" at each other in the year 2020, is not due to an event that happened unexpectedly recently. This is a problem that has been dormant for centuries. Different communities, and different individuals have experienced or interpreted the incompatibility problem in different ways. For some it was a serious problem and for others it was \""surmountable problems\"". According to experts, one of the biggest differences between whites and blacks, which also causes a lot of friction, is the proven difference in intellectual abilities. Black South Africans? average I.Q. is between 60 and 70, and that of whites is between 100 and 110, but that of Chinese is even higher than whites. Clearly, no country can be successfully governed by people with an I.Q. of 70. The blacks rule simply because they won the \""one-man-one-vote-one-time\"" election with their larger numbers and there is no way that 4 million whites can beat a majority of 40 million blacks at the ballot box. Over the last 100 years, blacks in South Africa?s numbers have risen by more than 1,000%, while whites have risen by only 240%. By the year 2030, whites will make up only 1% of the country?s population, but there are still compatriots who believe: \""We can beat the blacks at the ballot box!\"" In the year 1890 the number of whites and the number of blacks was roughly equal, but in 2020 the ratio is in the region of 4:50 and the difference is getting bigger by the day. If we had pursued a two-state policy in the year 1950, we could have had a world-class Cape Confederation today ? 70 years later. We are dealing here with a huge OVERPOPULATION PROBLEM. In the 1960?s, water experts told Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd that southern Africa has a serious water shortage. The population in 1961 was already alarmingly high by then. One of the engineers at the Department of Water Affairs said that our country?s water supply is only enough for 60 Million people. \""If we, the people of South Africa, were as disciplined as the Japanese, we MAYBE have enough water for 80 million people,\"" he said. But we all know how undisciplined South Africans are, and how much water we waste every day. In a city like Welkom, millions of litres of water are wasted every day. In every neighborhood of Welkom there are dozens of streets that look like rivers. Residents complain to the municipality every day about water leaks, but it is as if they do not exist. All complaints are simply ignored. There are probably only a handful of municipalities in the whole country that are not yet bankrupt. Why? Because the people in charge have no idea about city management. With an I.Q. of 70 it is impossible to run a city or town successfully. Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, warned that a black government in South Africa would mean the end of this country. And, former President P.W. Botha, warned that the black man did not have the ability to govern a country. From 1969 to 1999, the late Jaap Marais warned people at every public meeting. Everything that happens to our country and people today, he predicted in those 30 years. The Natte (National Party) yelled at him, tossed tomatoes at him and eggs, broke tables and chairs, and rampaged like bulls in a china shop. They were ashamed of the truth, just as many people today are still afraid and ashamed of the truth. Former President Paul Kruger also warned. \""Please do not let the bantu overwhelm you. If it is really necessary now, make sure that their numbers are not more than those of our people!\"" The old president was referring to the cheap black labour that the British mining magnates imported to replace white workers. But the people did not listen to him. Instead of the people applying SELF-EMPLOYMENT, most of them simply got 2 or 3 black labourers for themselves. Today, there are so many \""cheap black workers\"" in our country, that there are 25 for every white family. Our nation is divided. As divided as we have ever been. One group lives in a dream world where there is no crime, no murder, no poverty, no unemployment, no unrest, no strikes, no looting of private property, and no unrest. They think Nelson Mandela?s \""rainbow nation\"" lives safely and contentedly in a Utopia. Then there is the group that has exactly the opposite experience. Who are victims of all of the above, and are traumatized. As mentioned before, the deterioration did not happen suddenly. The decline has come a long way. When Mr. De Klerk became president, many compatriots knew, \""the beginning of the end has arrived\"". The lack of confidence in a black government is therefore not something new. World leaders, as well as national leaders, knew that a black government would destroy the country. Too few compatriots, for too long, have been interested in politics and in world events. We often accuse overseas countries, such as the USA, of ignorance about South Africa. Some of our people say that Europeans know \""nothing\"" about South Africa, and they say and write many lies about our country. But, South Africans (and especially compatriots) are just as ignorant about events in our country. It is a pity that voters cannot take a course in elections, and write an exam, before going to the polls. When a voter wants to vote for a candidate, he must first be able to provide prove that he knows the candidate or what he stands for. In the 1992 referendum, it was very clear that those 2 million YES voters did not know who and what F.W. de Klerk was. If they knew him, no one would have voted YES. Those who can think, who have a mind, should now ? after 250 years ? see that \""OIL AND WATER DO NOT MIX!\"" Why still cling to a new South Africa, where our country is only deteriorating? Why not just divorce? In a Cape Confederacy, where we will be on our own, things will and must be better. A two-state solution is the only solution? that is: \""If our people are at all interested in solutions\"". ? Peter Murray ? ",sa-news,0
"Does NASPERS Give Your DSTV, Takealot or News24 Data to ANC Government? They Do in China! Is NASPERS an Immoral Corporation?","Exposing Immoral Profits! NASPERS & its shareholders were caught offside with a 31% stake in the Devils work. Should or Will NASPERS Sell off Tencent now? Will Shareholders take a moral stand? Will Mainstream Media in SA now actually do journalism instead of just acting like megaphones for the ANC party line, like happens in China? Finally, thanks to Trump yet again, the world knows that NASPERS is an immoral company that is prepared to do the devils work for profit. While most NASPERS shareholders chose to ignore SA-News articles of NASPERS? regulatory obedience to the Chinese Communist Party, which controls all Chinese companies, they can no longer ignore it, and have a stark choice to make: Sell or knowingly profit from human rights abuses, mass censorship, abuse of privacy through mass spying and data capture, and Chinese communist world supremacism. However there are bigger questions for South Africa to answer? Will SA continue letting the Elephant in the Room, which makes up 20% of the entire Index, dominate and influence its stock market, not to mention doing so from unethical business practices in Communist China? Either NASPERS sells its stake in WeChat owner Tencent, or it and its shareholders will remain forever tainted. Or does NASPERS hope these immoral practices become the norm in SA too? The fact remains it was those immoral profits that drew the investors in SA and abroad, likewise it was and is those immoral activities that influence the SA Stock Exchange. What is NASPERS? relationship with ANC and even SACP? South African interests are under focus as US President Donald Trump extends his banning of Chinese companies and social media APPS which fall under the control of the Communist Party of China (CCP). Trump said he wants to ban WeChat, a Chinese super APP with more than a Billion users, mostly in China. WeChat, which is leading to a cashless society in China, was developed by Chinese company Tencent, in which NASPERS owns a 31% stake. This is on top of a Tik-Tok ban that may or may not end with Microsoft buying it. But there is something more chilling about WeChat and the reasons for the ban, regardless of whether or not its necessary for national security. Trump?s new Executive Order bans US transactions with Tik-Tok owner Bytedance and Chinese Big Tech titan Tencent as well as their parent companies, which puts NASPERS in the firing line. The WeChat messaging & payment platform joined the embattled video-sharing network Tik-Tok on the list of APPS that cannot operate in the US unless they are sold to Western companies. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said America will purge untrusted Chinese APPS from US APP Stores. Trump?s ban on Tik-Tok and WeChat were Presidential Executive Orders based on the international emergency economic powers act, which allows Trump to ban transactions between the US and foreign entities suspected of being a national security risk. However this goes beyond just a security risk for USA, or indeed profits for NASPERS investors, and could change China?s sometimes insidious influence over the rest of the world. WeChat is far more than a messaging APP and there?s actually no equivalent APP that does all the things WeChat does. This is mostly because anti trust laws and Western regulation prevent this kind of monopolistic dominance with government control. On WeChat you can chat with your friends, and also send them money through WeChat, and pay your utility bills through WeChat, while grabbing a coffee on your way to work and pay for it contactlessly within WeChat. You can rent a bicycle or take a taxi and also buy tickets for a high-speed rail or flight from within WeChat. When you arrive you can buy movie tickets with WeChat, then find yourself a nice hotel, etc. all without leaving the WeChat APP! So it is a mega APP, but the downside is that with all your activity and data on one APP, it is basically spyware for the Chinese Communist Party. Because WeChat is owned by the Chinese company Tencent, in which NASPERS has the largest stake (31%), and Tencent is China?s second most valuable company after Alibaba, according to Chinese law, any Chinese company has to turn over user data to the Chinese government! So WeChat collects user data from a Billion people, and especially those outside China, like in USA. The WeChat APP has full permission on your phone to activate microphones and cameras and track your geo location, access your address book and photos and copy all of this data at any time to their servers, and WeChat is also tracking your spending habits. WeChat also censors what people can say in their private messages, it even censors accounts of people in America for talking about things the Chinese communist regime is sensitive about, like Hong Kong, According to internet watchdog group, The Citizen Lab, WeChat?s parent company Tencent, created an extraordinarily advanced censorship algorithm, to automatically identify combinations of keywords, that it then blocks in addition to censoring messages. It also forces and coerces users to not send those messages in the first place, by blocking certain APP functions until they stop, or they ban the user?s account. This is a big problem for users inside China because your whole life is on WeChat, but if you?re in China, that might be the least of your problems, because what you say on WeChat can land you in prison! Tibetans have been jailed for wishing the Dalai Lama a happy birthday on WeChat! Falun Gong practitioners inside China have been detained for over a year for sending messages relating to Falun Gong on WeChat. People have been jailed for spreading news, spreading rumors and making fun of Chinese officials on WeChat. Dr. Lee Won Leon, the whistle-blowing doctor from Wuhan who tried to warn his colleagues about the Coronavirus back in December, was detained for that and eventually died from the Coronavirus. The police got to him because he sent his Coronavirus warning in a private group message on WeChat! WeChat in China is both essential and dangerous, but it isn?t used much in the US, so why is Trump banning it? When announcing the action against Tencent, the Trump administration said that WeChat captures vast swathes of data and information from its users, potentially exposing the personal information of Americans and Chinese nationals living in the US, to exploitation by China?s ruling Communist Party. However, there?s actually a bigger reason for the ban as well, as China has been trying for years to gain more control over how the rest of the world communicates, so it includes trying to dominate telecommunications through companies like Huawei and ZTE. They also try to control the global internet by making Chinese technology a foundation for the global flow of information and transactions, and thus to expand the Chinese Communist Party?s leverage, influence and power worldwide. Once the US realized what was happening, it started trying to prevent China from taking over global communications. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lays out the goal in his statement on clean networks, when he said \""the clean network program is the Trump administration?s comprehensive approach to guarding our citizens privacy and our companies? most sensitive information from aggressive intrusions by malign actors such as the Chinese Communist Party.\"" Banning Tik-Tok and WeChat is part of a larger strategy to purge Beijing?s influence and access in US telecommunications, but it is also meant to degrade the attractiveness of Chinese-made communications products and services to overseas buyers as well, which could have the larger effect of obstructing the Chinese Communist party?s attempt at global information control. WeChat is not actually a bridge between China and the world, but is a prison that traps the minds of overseas Chinese people, as if they have never left China, and sucks all Chinese into the black hole of censorship and surveillance. There is a reason why people use WeChat?s glorified spyware, and that is because the Chinese regime blocked pretty much every non-chinese communications APP in China! Was there an agreement between NASPERS and the Chinese Communist Party? No doubt NASPERS is against the ban, as is corporate America. Apple for instance might not be able to have WeChat on iPhones or sell it in their APP Store and according to a million person plus survey in China, 95% of Chinese iPhone owners would abandon Apple without WeChat! Imagine Apple losing the China market. However this would be karma because Apple banned all American APPS in their Chinese APP Store because the Chinese government told them to. What company does NASPERS keep? Last week more than a dozen major US multinational corporations called the White House about the ban. Some of those on the call included Ford Motor Company, Walmart, Disney, Procter & Gamble, Intel, Metlife, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UPS and many more. Seems gigantic multinational companies are upset because they cannot make ungodly sums of money working with the brutal authoritarian regime. NASPERS considers itself part of that crowd? ",sa-news,0
"Blood Soaked Floors & Walls in Suburbia is NOT \""Normal Crime\""! ANC Regime & Liberals Malicious Negligence Puts Target on Back of ALL Whites!","KNEELING TO BLACKS WILL NOT STOP BLOODTHIRSTY HOME INVASIONS! These scenes of blood soaked floors and walls, after yet another violent attack by black males, is the result of the constant rhetoric from mainstream media and ANC government. The constant repetition that all whites are bad people who allegedly stole the land, are all racists, are all rich from colonialism and deserve to be killed, has literally put a target on the back of whites! Even without all this manipulative and blatant encouragement by the ANC Regime and liberal media, blacks were happy to steal from whites whenever they could, ever since their raids across the Fish river to steal livestock 200 years ago. In fact this crime wave is what prompted the British colonial government to bring in settlers to the Eastern Cape, to put in as a buffer between the marauding Africans and the farmers whose livestock they were stealing. Seems little has changed. The excuse about farm attacks and murders is that they are rural and thus easy targets. So how do they explain away bloody and deadly home invasions in residential areas? These extremely violent attacks are definitely not happening only on farms. To mainstream media this is JUST another attack on a white couple by blacks in South Africa ? it is all quite normal apparently. It is even a daily occurrence now. The liberals and black supremacists will call this ordinary crime, but don?t be fooled by them anymore. They call it ordinary crime deliberately to hide the truth and avoid responsibility for the hellhole their liberal policies created. Do white lives matter anymore? Rudi Stoltz (58) and his wife Adri (50) were violently and brutally attacked in their home in Hofmeyer singel, Sabie during a home invasion attack on Thursday afternoon 13 August, 2020. The couple was busy holding a birthday party for their 28 year old physically disabled daughter ,just after 20:00 when the attack happened. According to the Lowvelder, the couple?s dog began to bark and Rudi went outside to investigate. (This is a common mistake because then people leave the relative safety of their home to go outside in the open and dark unarmed. Why would a dog begin to bark fiercely? Surely this could indicate possible danger. Look through windows instead. This is pointed out as a safety tip because people have been attacked numerous times when they went out to investigate. This should not be happening over and over again). When Rudi returned from outside, he was attacked by three black males, and the blood stained floors and walls of the house were silent evidence of the brutal nature of the attack. That and numerous very serious injuries to Rudi?s body caused by the blows of the merciless bloodthirsty attackers. Why the brutality if they were three male attackers with weapons against one man? Rudi was beaten all over his body and sustained numerous fractures including to his skull and hip. Like always during this type of attack, the attackers were looking for cash and weapons. Are they building an army? Adri was also injured but not as serious as Rudi. She was beaten over the head with a firearm and sustained head injuries as well as to her hand and arm. The couple?s daughter was not injured. The couple both had to undergo emergency operations after the attack and both are being treated at the Mediclinic hospital. No suspects have been arrested.

Reject BLM! Its an Aggressive Anti-White Campaign in the Left Wings War for World Supremacy!,"THIRD WORLD WAR? Isn?t it ironic that whites are the only race that are constantly accused of supremacy, yet I do not know a single white person who wants to dominate the whole world? Do you know of such an ambitious person? (No, Soros, Rothschild, Oppenheimer, etc. are not white). But, if we look at who it is that pushes this white man bad, black man good, narrative, then we discover who it is that really wants to dominate the whole world. It is not one group, but they all realized that whites, who stopped slavery, but make up only 10% of the world population, are the biggest obstacle in their attempts at world supremacy, so they joined forces to get rid of whites! Just imagine what will happen when there are no more Europeans, and the Communists, Islamists, Blacks, Chinese and Jews start fighting among themselves for world supremacy. This is why whites should reject BLM as if their lives depended on it! Imagine picking up a newspaper and reading it as follows, with such large black letters: THIRD WORLD WAR RAGES WORLDWIDE! LIBERAL COMMANDER GEORGE SOROS AND CO?S IDEOLOGICAL ARMY OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS MARCH AMID SLOGANS AND REFRAINS LIKE BLM AND KILL WHITES! THE ADVANCING BLM ARMY HAS WHITE PEOPLE COWERING AND BENDING THE KNEE BEFORE THEM WORLDWIDE! GLOBALIST LEFT WING ALLIANCE POWERS BEGIN TO GET THE UPPER HAND TO CHANGE WORLD HISTORY FOREVER! THE NEW WORLD ORDER IS HERE! Or is it? One of the reasons why the ANC can oppress our minorities in South Africa at will, both white and brown, is that we do not really believe in anything anymore. Through persistent mass media propaganda over the decades, we have been reduced to a bunch of brainwashed people, who believe everything that the liberal media, state and Church, which also fell to liberalism, tell us. Go and see what is the connection between the Church and liberalism. The Catholic Church proclaims the liberal doctrine as its own while other Churches are not far behind. All leftist policies like LGBTxyz, abortion, racemixing, mass immigration, etc. etc. are now official church policy! Soros and the New World Order, together with the communists and other left wing comrades-in-arms have long realized that if they want to conquer nations and their people, then they must conquer their Churches. This while the ANC, black rulers, Communists, Islamists and Jews of course have a very strong ideology based on their identity, but they sneakily hide behind the African narrative, traditionalism and black supremacy. BLM. The liberals and blacks, as natural \""useful idiots\"", naturally join them, out of free will because they endorse the black domination ideology front ? the tyranny by the black majority. The ANC / EFF, of course, joins the international globalist, liberal, communist, Islamic Alliance with their strong anti-white and pro-black and pro-Islamic onslaught ? in fact, an attack on anything that is white Western and its culture. Our problem as minorities in South Africa is actually the problem of all white Westerners everywhere in the world. A total lack of identity after it was sneakily stolen from us over the years. A total lack of ideology or something to believe in, after it has been slyly obscured and corrupted over the decades. It could mean the end of the white man everywhere in the world, not just in South Africa, because the black rulers and liberals, or the BLM people, have a very strong ideology and motivation. So what are our motivations and beliefs as white people ? Afrikaners or any other white people? Remember the liberals / globalists / pan African blacks / Islamists / Jews can simply mes with us because they do not have to care about their own identity. They call us racists as we pursue national identity while maintaining a very strong identity themselves, of who they are and actively developing it. They accuse us of white supremacy while they are black supremacists or Islamic supremacists etc.. They do so with a specific purpose of keeping us identityless and trapped in the liberal politically correct worldview (as pushed and endorsed by the Establishment, Hollywood and international sports bodies), that white is bad, and black is good. They trick us with lies and a sleight of hand while we are too busy working for a good quality of life, or too busy watching TV or sports or shopping. Do not fall for their tricks. Rediscover who you are as a minority, and start thinking about how our future, and the future of our children, are being destroyed by ourselves, as we are tricked by black supremacists and liberals with no limits in their deceit. Straighten your back and decide who you are and what you want to be. Just do not think the black pan Africanists and Islamists, with liberals and communists as allies, will ever give up their identity and beliefs. It will indeed throw the world back into the dark ages, from which Europeans brought mankind out of? ",sa-news,0
VIDEO: Why Whites Should NEVER Trust Politicians Again! They All LIED Except for PW Botha Whose Prediction Came True!,"A Nation Conquered by ONE Word! These are the blatant, globalist paid for lies which enabled the ANC?s, terrorist driven, violent coup d?etat of 1994, where they not only annexed a dozen self governing nations in one foul swoop, but before, during and after the coup, white South Africans and their society were, and still are, literally terrorized, ransacked, raped and murdered in staggering numbers. The terrorism, violence and the lies from within the captured white government, created an abnormal regime, in which these horrific attacks are hidden and even justified by the veil of false political correctness, which was given to the bantu by the liberal Global World Order and Communism?s Politically Correct \""anti-racism\"" weapon. As a result, bantu captured a first world country, way beyond their means and ability to create, never mind manage, just as PW Botha predicted. The ANC and bantu won the worlds biggest lottery, one which the mighty British empire sacrificed tens of thousands of men to win in multiple wars. That win now defines the ANC and bantu, and they know, the only way forward is down, as it is impossible for them to build upon something which they could not have built in the first place! This is the reason, to this day they still have to sing the anti-racism song which The Communists from Soviet Russia and Cuba, as well as the Deep State socialists in the West taught them. Scores of blacks were taken to Moscow, London, USA and Canada to be trained in the evil art of subversion and deceit, whilst pretending to be lawyers, journalists, \""freedom fighters\"" etc. These malicious brainwashed people are still active in South African society today, and so the terror, attacks, rapes and murders continue as the bantu dismantles and consumes our society!

ANCs Home Affairs Incapable of Arranging SA Passport Extensions for SAFFAs Stuck Abroad but Extends Visas for Foreigners in SA Again!,"Malicious Negligence? The ANC?s Minister of Home Affairs, Aaron Motsoaledi, recently announced yet another extension of visas for foreigners in South Africa, however, he has bizarrely refused to, or is incapable of making any arrangements for South Africans stuck abroad, whose passports will expire as a result of the extended lockdowns worldwide. The DA called on Minister Motsoaledi to urgently facilitate passport extensions for South African nationals stuck abroad without any further delay. According to Section 21(4) of the Constitution, every citizen has the right to a passport and for those South Africans stuck abroad, the expiry of their passport could mean dire consequences for their immigration status, visas, work, travel and ability to access healthcare. Since writing to the Minister, proposing a passport validity extension stamp, the only step taken was the opening of some passport renewals at South African missions abroad, which indicates either a lack of interest or a lack of ability to get the job done. But this has made little difference and the DA has been inundated with calls for help from citizens facing closed signs, evasive treatment, \""out of office\"" emails and unanswered calls from SA Embassies and Consulates, something which they have grown used even during normal times. The largest Home Affairs office abroad, in London, remains closed while the rest of London is coming back to full speed. Applicants are told to email requests and these emails either receive an out of office response, falsely claiming that the High Commission is closed, or remain largely unanswered. Phone calls are not answered yet applicants who go to the office to plead urgency find no queues and no clients being served. There is currently a two-month waiting list just to get an appointment to submit a passport application at the UAE mission. Meanwhile, colleagues of these SAFFAs from India, Pakistan, Sudan, Kenya, Nepal have passports processed in between 3 days and 3 weeks through their embassies. Further afield the last diplomatic bag to return to Hanoi only had one passport despite dozens of applications waiting since as far back as March 2019. A South African missionary in South America has been waiting for almost two years to have her passport renewed and has had to submit new passport photographs no less than six times. The struggling Minister Motsoaledi needs to face the fact that Home Affairs is incapable of dealing with this growing backlog of passport applications through a system that has been ineffective even long before lockdown. The DA?s proposal of extending passports through a stamp is a reasonable and pragmatic approach which will allow ANC?s struggling Home Affairs to focus on passport applications of newborns and cope with the demand during the lockdown.

"VIDEO: \""You Accessed Power to Put Money in Your Pocket & Are Stealing Public Resources!\"" Mbeki to NDZ 6 Years Ago!","At a \""Leadership for the Africa we Want\"" event in Kigali, Rwanda way back in 2014, Thabo Mbeki looked directly at Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ) and said \""You have accessed power in order to put money in your pocket. You Are Stealing Public Resources.\"" NDZ?s face made it clear she knew he was addressing her? The issues being discussed at the event were: 1. How can we nurture visionary African leadership to address any leadership deficit and engender trust in policies? 2. Does Africa need effective institutions more than it needs strong leaders? Thabo however broke ranks and raised the ugly truth about corruption. A year later, during the launch of TMALI, he once again brought up the uncomfortable topic, claiming \""there is no Ruling Party in Africa That Does not Have Corruption!\"" Thabo also raised his pet topic, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and Africa?s membership thereof. If video does not load above, watch here: https://youtu.be/NbMXQEW2iew The globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) report for 2014 identified two critical leadership problems in Africa ? Firstly is that there is a leadership deficit, and the second is that there is a lack of trust in policies and programmes pursued by leaders. It has only gotten worse. Good leadership is crucial for enabling Africa to exploit the window of opportunity that has opened up in the past decade, notably its natural resource boom. However, experience indicates that leaders that are resourceful and accountable may be more important \""initial conditions\"" for the development and transformation of their countries than resource abundance per se. Where leadership was inadequate or unaccountable, the pace of industrialization and innovation stagnated, and in some cases was reversed, irrespective of the size of the resource base. In the absence of good leadership, Africa will not be able to reach its global potential.

"What is The \""Two State Solution\"" Being Discussed All Over Social Media? Everyone From A to Z Wants to Escape ANCs Gangster State!","With the extended lockdown, extra totalitarian powers and historic looting by the ANC regime, everyone is wondering how we are going to get out of this predicament, and self-determination, independence, emigration and secession are now being discussed everywhere, and not just by the minorities! From A to Z ? Afrikaners to Zulus, have finally realized that the rainbow nation has taken away their sovereignty. How did we get here? Nothing happens in the present, that has not been ordered in the past, so we have to start in the last century when the National Party was in power, after they won the nationwide election in 1948. Various terrorist organizations, including the ANC (African National Congress), had been officially declared terrorist groups internationally and banned in South Africa. The ANC, which was found in Bloemfontein in 1912 as a black nationalist movement against the white British Union of South Africa, was guilty of terrorist acts, such as throwing bombs at soft targets, such as churches. In 1963, during the Rivonia trial, the ANC was indicted of several acts of terrorism, and officially declared a terrorist organization. The party, along with other hostile parties, were declared undesirable. The ANC had to operate underground from then on, and was responsible for many deadly acts of terrorism with the support of Communist Russia and Cuba. Most readers know this history, so I do not need to elaborate on it now, as it is a topic in itself anyway. As far as history goes, the 2 indigenous races (the Khoi and the San) were first in Southern Africa, and according to experts, for about 20,000 to 30,000 years at the southern tip of Africa. Black tribes from West and Central Africa drove the Khoi and the San further south, after killing many of these indigenous people. Tribes and even other African races such as the Sandawe, Hadza, Pygmy, San, etc. were wiped out or assimilated by the southward migrating bantu. Caravel 1400Portuguese seafarers tried to find a sea route between Portugal and the rich Eastern lands. Africa was still mostly an unknown continent to Europeans. Some people believed the earth was round, others said the earth was flat. The Portuguese wanted to find out if Africa had an \""end\"", and if so, where it was. The last bantu they encountered on their long journey south, down the west coast of Africa, was in northern Angola. From Angola to the north coast of Mozambique, there were no blacks to be seen? only the nomadic Khoi and the San. It was in 1488 when the Portuguese arrived in present-day Mossel Bay. There was no sight of bantu. Bartolomias Dias Bartolomias Dias was the first European to reach the southern tip of Africa, and to sail the Cape. It was the year 1488. No black people were spotted by him or his sailors on the mainland. In recent years, black leaders have been falsely claiming that they were \""first\"" in South Africa, and that Jan van Riebeeck stole the land from the blacks. Because almost all passengers on Jan van Riebeeck?s 3 passenger ships and 2 cargo ships could read and write, and do arithmetic, it was never a problem as to when and where who set foot ashore. The Europeans at the Cape were literate people. But no black could read or write in 1652. Therefore, they do not know when they arrived in South Africa from Central Africa. Missionaries from London and from Europe had to design a written language for every black language group in South Africa. taal monument Our French ancestors, the Huguenots, arrived in Table Bay in 1688. The first group was 180 members. This monument was erected in Franschhoek in honor of the Protestants in South Africa. Black leaders often hold meetings in their own communities, where the people are incited to wage war against foreigners. The hatred of the blacks towards whites has been incited and has increased tremendously since 1994. From 1948 to 1988, the RSA (Republic of South Africa) had 5 leaders (first Prime Ministers, who later became Presidents) who were fairly conservative. But in the late 1980?s, the much more liberal Mr. F.W. de Klerk took over the reins as president. He released all terrorists, after 2 million people gave him a mandate in 1992, to negotiate with the blacks. De Klerk is a lawyer who knew the local as well as international legal systems well. He also knew the voters well, and probably realized that most voters were ignorant and naive. By planning his word choice well, he was able to mislead the electorate around the bush. He ostensibly wanted to create a \""better\"" South Africa, but he did not say in detail HOW he was going to do it. Thus 5 million whites lost their homeland. Between 1990 and 2020, South Africa lost about 1.2 million white citizens. Most tried to flee to safety. This later led to a \""brain drain\"", as more and more academics, such as doctors and engineers, left the country. About 40,000 doctors emigrated to Canada and the United States in particular. From 1990 to 2020, about 150,000 whites, and 500,000 blacks, were killed by blacks. In 1994, the ANC achieved a predicted overwhelming victory at the ballot box and black hatred of whites began to grow. It is still growing daily, and more and more farm murders are being committed. In the last 30 years, approximately 4,000 to 4,500 white farmers (read FOOD PRODUCERS) have been killed on or near their property. The Commando system, which was to protect farmers, was declared a banned organization. Farmers had to protect their own property against livestock thieves and murder gangs at great expense. The RSA (Republic of South Africa) is now almost 60 years old, having been established on 31 May 1961. Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, adv B.J. Vorster, Mr. P.W. Botha, and Mr F w de Klerk, served as presidents of the RSA, but in 1994 the RSA was handed over to a black, Socialist-Communist ANC government for political correctness. Because it was described as a so-called \""democratic\"" election, and a \""one-man-one-vote\"" system was followed, the approximately 5 million whites had no chance of matching the 40 million black masses at the ballot box. This was 100% expected, and a large proportion of whites refused to participate in the election. The HNP (Herstigte Nationale Party), for example, decided in principle never to participate in an election in which the ANC is involved. They (the HNP) do not recognize the new ANC government at all, and consider it illegal. This year (2020) it is 26 years that the ANC has been in power, and no progress has been made in any area. The Dutch-speaking whites, who arrived in Table Bay in 1652, met the colored people for the first time in 1652, and the black people over a century later in 1770, a thousand kilometers to the east. We can therefore say that we have known the blacks for 250 years, and therefore know what to expect. But, if one studies the comings and goings of all groups well, it seems that we do not know each other at all. It?s amazing to see how naive and ignorant many whites can still be after 250 years, because our cultures do not fit together at all, on the contrary, we sometimes differ like day versus night. Our nation?s torrid history of 368 years is full of examples of clashes between whites and blacks because \""Oil and water can not mix, no matter how hard you try\"". To be continued.

ANC Desperate To Keep Golden White Goose Enslaved! Kamiesberg ANC Municipality Cant Pay Bills Yet Attacks Thriving White Settlement!,"ANC Cries Out in Pain as They Strike You: The ANC run Municipality of Kamiesberg in the Northern Cape is radicalising residents, as they appear to be scared they will lose their most profitable residents, so they arranged a hit piece aired on the ANC?s national mouthpiece, SABC, to play the old, old, old racecard, yet again. Yawn? Yet they ignore over 5,000 big towns that are 100% bantu ? no Whites, coloureds or indians! Even Soweto is more race pure than Orania and 1,000 times bigger, but not a word from these racebaiting genocidal hypocrites! Eureka, the thriving white Afrikaner settlement in Garies, which is striving for legal and constitutional self determination, as a defense against punitive anti white BBBEE laws, barbaric Farm Murders and the malicious destruction of Afrikaans, is a regular easy target for the SABC, ANC and communist ANC Mayor, Mervyn Cloete, who wants to pull everyone in town down into the ANC sh*thole, to the lowest common denominator, except themselves of course, as communists do? Residents of the Kamiesberg municipal area in the Northern Cape are being polarised and radicalised by the ANC councilors against the white Afrikaner settlement of Eureka near Garies. The settlement was established a few years ago on private property owned by Adriaan Nieuwoudt and hopes to be a haven for around 5,000 families & refugees fleeing the persecution and oppression by the anti white ANC regime. The Kamiesberg municipality which cannot even pay its own bills, has however already spent money on several legal challenges against Eureka. The ANC?s mouthpiece, SABC broadcast a one sided hit piece report, in which it gave national exposure to a hate filled highly politisiced \""Garies resident\"", without showing who he represents, nor what or how big his mandate is? However they did not interview a member of the Eureka settlement for their viewpoint. Instead of being interviewed, residents of Eureka are demonised and called \""illegal residents\"", yet the ANC allows, encourages and even busses in hordes of illegal squatters wherever they want to change the demographic and manipulate election results. Adriaan Nieuwoudt has stated categorically that they have not received any opposition from local residents, but only from the malicious ANC municipality, which is now instigating local residents, like the ANC always does. Will the ANC bring out their infamous \""necklacing\"" tool again to burn a few locals, to convince them to \""rise up\""? (Nearly 1,000 black moderates were burnt alive by radical ANC activists before 1994 elections). The SABC also gave the local ANC Mayor their national platform to spew his hatred and Socialist propaganda, yet failed to mention that the Eureka settlement is part of a self determination project supported by the Nama Chief and also King Swartbooi. But then we already know the ANC want to keep Khoisan and Whites totally oppressed, because they have the most to fear from them. The ANC mayor claims \""our people\"" are bound to the land, saying they will fight for \""land reform\"", but fails to mention that all land ends up in ANC state ownership, and \""our people\"" will only be tenants of the state, renting land, never owning it. Communism 101. As SA-News has reported, there are over 5,000 towns with more than 5,000 residents that are 100% bantu ? no Whites, Coloureds or Indians. Even Soweto, still with its apartheid era name, is more race pure than Orania, just 1,000 times bigger, and it too has put a MASSIVE burden on the state for unpaid electricity bills. Without the white man, the gravy train would stop and ANC cadres would be eating grass, and it is clear they know this, and refuse to let their tax slaves go? transformasie ",sa-news,0
"#VoetsekANC  Minorities are Gatvol of ANC and its Bantu Supremacy, Time for the Two-State Solution! Even FF+ Stick Out Feelers!"," It is no coincidence that the hashtag #VoetsekANC and talk of an Independent Cape was rising on social media in the same week, but what is surprising is that Dr Corné Mulder of VFplus, after two decades of silence about this, now suddenly pops out with this idea. It is also interesting that he mentions only one of the half dozen Independence initiatives, one that depends on the ANC?s co-operation! SA-News has regularly reported on this issue over the years, and we have now appointed a columnist, Peter Murray, to regularly cover this topic for us. There are only two of the Cape Independence initiatives that do not require the ANC?s co-operation, so keep an eye out for Peter?s regular column \""Two State Solution\"" on SA-News. VFplus?s Dr Corné Mulder is of the opinion that the increased trend towards secession for the Western Cape is a direct result of the ANC?s failed handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, but I myself know, since I promoted the Independent Cape back in 1994 in my Cape newspapers, that it has slowly built up, until the last election, when people realized that come what may, no matter how bad it gets, the Bantu are going to vote for ANC time and time again, because Bantu vote by race. The minorities in SA have begun to realize that SA cannot be saved from Bantu?s excesses and consumption. Few Bantu will vote for a white person if there is a black candidate, but whites and other minorities do not sit with this built-in racism. Well, not since whites were so thoroughly beaten with the white guilt whip It is also disappointing that FFplus? Dr Corné Mulder reduces the whole CODESA story to simply \""at that time at Codesa, the FF and the IFP asked for more powers for provinces. It was unfortunately shot down by the ANC, NP and DA.\"" Why does the VFplus party even have the word \""Freedom\"" in its name, we wonder, if they can so twist history and all the late Genl. Konstandt Viljoen?s work, and negate the existence of the Zulu Trustlands and just wipe it all away? But this is how we got to know Dr. Corné Mulder during the oppression of our people over the last two decades. Funny also that he does not mention Catalonia, the most visible independence-seeking country as an example. Probably because the reason Catalonia is not gaining their independence, is because they are asking the Spanish state for permission, which is outrageous. But CapExit, which Cornê Mulder is promoting, is going to do exactly that, ask for the ANC?s cooperation, which is just as outrageous! The only two initiatives that do not require the ANC?s co-operation, because they operate under international law, are the United Freedom Alliance (ULA), and the Khoisan?s Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) Declaration. With a view to increased and better general knowledge about this critical issue, Peter Murray is going to regularly inform us about how it works, what we can do and how it is progressing. Peter Murray, a retired journalist currently living in the Orange Free State, was born in Port Elizabeth in 1946. He had 4 years of experience in the printing industry in Namibia and South Africa, was a reporter and photographer for various newspapers in South Africa for 12 years, and was freelance reporter for various newspapers in Europe for 20 years.

"Africas Cowardly Black Hyenas Murder, Pillage & Rape Innocent Defenseless Children & Grandmothers!","There is No Excuse: The last week has seen a horrendous escalation in attacks on white people, not only in number but also in violence. SA-News looks at just five of the vicious and barbaric attacks that took place on innocent people, to clearly illustrate how even though multiple black men, could easily just take anything they wanted to steal and walk away, they don?t, they rape and murder unnecessarily, so there can be no excuse and no apologism for these primitive hyenas, who roam amongst us, and are protected by the ANC government, EFF, BLF, liberals and the black masses. The psyche of Africans is suffering irreparable damage. 1. Black savages invade home and mercilessly beat up 73 year old father and rape his wife and two young daughters! The home of a family was invaded last Friday on a smallholding in Zwartkop, Muldersdrift. The 73 year father was savagely beaten, whilst he was tied up. The man?s wife was raped as well as their 15 and their 11 year daughters. This happened after the barbarians demanded money and the father could not give the attackers any because he did not have any. There have been no arrest in this case. We are failing the victims of these heinous acts. We simply have to do more to bring these atrocities to the world?s attention. Please share this and every attack like this on social media. Home invasion attacks have risen sharply in the Muldersdrift area. People living there have to be on the highest level of alert possible. Numerous home invasion attacks have been reported in the Lindley, Zwartkop and Nooitgedacht areas of Muldersdrift the past month. We the white minority of South Africa is facing a full scale slow war now and nearing the phase of a slow genocide. Do what you can to protect yourself and your families. The time for complacency is over. Where is the outrage, why is liberal mainstream media ignoring atrocities this? Do White Lives Matter? 2. \""It felt like being attacked by a pack of wild dogs\"" says woman who was badly beaten and raped in Dendron farm attack. She is telling the truth. Farm attackers in South Africa don?t come gently and ask nicely for the possessions of their victims. They come like devil worshiping barbarians, brutal and savage and trying to hurt and humiliate as much as possible. Please do your bit to inform the world of these atrocities by posting it on social media because liberal media is hiding this news. We have been intentionally ignoring this for too long. Tomorrow it is your own family and loved ones and it is better to make the world aware right now. Nothing will change until the world does not know the full reality of the slow war being waged against the white minority in South Africa. \""Shoot me if you want to\"" a grandmother of 98 told three black male attackers who broke into her room on the farm near Dendron, Limpopo around 0100 on Wednesday morning 29 July, 2020. At that moment her 61 year old daughter-in-law came into the room because she saw the light on. It was then that the attackers left the grandmother and mercilessly attacked her daughter and assaulted and raped her. The woman?s 62 year old husband was tied with wire to a chair. He was savagely beaten all over his body. The woman was also shot in her right upper leg. The man?s head was also repeatedly banged against the wall by the attackers. The attackers demanded money but the couple don?t keep money in the house so they could not give it to them. The attackers plundered the house and fled with a TV and firearms that they took from the house in the couple?s white Navarra bakkie. The woman had just enough power left in her body to untie her husband who could make it to the house of a worker where they could call for help. The Police spotted the bakkie on the Matlala road outside Polokwane and gave chase. The Police arrested 2 attackers and shot and wounded another. The stolen firearms were also recovered. The injured farming couple were admitted to hospital in critical condition whilst the grandmother was not injured and is staying with other family at the moment. 3. ELDERLY WOMAN LEFT SPEECHLESS WITH SHOCK AS HER SON SHOT TO DEATH IN HIS BED DURING UMTEENTH HOME INVASION ATTACK ON FARMS AND SMALLHOLDINGS. BLACK-ON-WHITE VIOLENCE GETS MORE SAVAGE BY THE DAY. LIBERAL MEDIA REMAINS QUIET. A 52 year old man was shot dead during a home invasion attack on a smallholding at Rooiwal, Pretoria North which happened on Thursday morning 6 July 2020 between 0100-0200. There were three black males involved in the attack and they gained entry by breaking open the front door. The terrorists fled with only a cellphone and laptop. Another media report indicated the mother was also assaulted and that she recently had a stroke. Marius Muller of Afriforum told Maroela Media that they tried to get more details from the mother but she is so traumatized she can?t really speak. It looks like the murdered man also wounded one attacker because there was a blood trail leading into the veld. Police searched for suspects but there were no arrests so far. 4. Police only investigating a housebreaking case after woman stabbed and hacked with a machete in Kroondal, Northwest farm attack This is what black criminals do to whites in South Africa but there is no uproar, barely a whimper. If whites would do these things to blacks, which we don?t, the area would burn and there will be a large scale attack on whites. The cruelty of black on white attacks which happens on farms should be made known now and the world must know now. Everyone who reads this must share this. This simply can?t go on like this. We are keeping quiet whilst black attackers are savagely slaughtering, raping and maiming us on a daily basis. Why is this allowed? Just because they are black and we are white? Are we so indoctrinated by the liberal world order where whites are regarded as bad and black is regarded as good that we just look the other way? This is nonsense. We can?t accept this anymore. And then a spokesperson told Netwerk24 that Police is only investigating a housebreaking when the victim was hacked with a panga on her upper legs so deep that muscles and nerves were chopped off. The victim was also stabbed several times in her upper body by 5 black male attackers. But yet no attempted murder charges are being investigated by Police despite the victim left in a very critically injured condition. Irene Muhl (64) was alone in the farmhouse at Kroondal, Northwest when she was attacked. Her husband Mark was busy with farming activities elsewhere on the farm. Mark was phoned by a security company to notify him that a panic button was activated in the farm house. He asked the security company and a family member to rush to the house and they discovered a very seriously injured Irene in the house. The suspects were gone, after plundering the house. .A laptop and mountain bike were some of the items stolen. There was a search by the farm watch afterwards but no suspect was arrested. 5. Another mother and father murdered and daughter wounded in home invasion attack inside gated community in Elandsfontein, Pretoria Not only South Africa but the world should start to take note what is happening. For years, since the ANC took over, tens of thousands of white people in South Africa have been mowed down by black attackers. Everyone kept on going about their own business, barely noticing or not noticing at all because it was not a family member of theirs. Now a week after a mother, father and their daughter were abducted and beaten and stabbed to death at Hartswater, another mother and father were murdered, shot to death, and their daughter wounded in an armed home invasion attack at the Fly Inn estate at Elandsfontein, Pretoria. It is a security complex with high walls where most residents own a light aircraft. There is also a runway for aircraft. The attack itself was like a military attack. It is reported there were three black male attackers who came into the house and opened fire on sight . Details are sketchy but it looks like the motive was house robbery because a laptop, two MacBook tablets and a TV are missing from the house.. It also looks like the attackers forced entry to the house by breaking a window. The couple who passed away on the scene from gunshot wounds have been identified as Janique and Wayne Giles . Their daughter Rachel was shot in the leg and was airlifted to hospital. Their son Brandon who also stays in the house was not shot.",sa-news,0
"Will US Gov. Consider Sanctions on ANC Government After Imposing Sanctions on \""Notoriously Corrupt\"" Zimbabwean Presidential Adviser?","The ANC regime has been given so much rope and tolerance, far more than would be needed to hang them all. Indeed calls and petitions for international intervention in Southern Africa are rising, and after having sanctioned the Guptas earlier, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, announced that US is imposing sanctions on one of Zimbabwe?s top businessmen and political advisers, for being \""notoriously corrupt\"", which should bring some hope to oppressed and ransacked SA citizens. USA gives corrupt South Africa approx. $9.4 Billion Dollars in US Aid, with no record of where it goes, so if it is notoriously corrupt USA wants, the ANC government includes a long list of very notorious gangsters, like Ace Magashule and the ANC \""top six\"" or Ramaphosa?s entire cabinet. A 2018 petition on the Whitehouse website, calling for intervention against the ANC regime, received 125,300 signatures. In a statement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo imposed sanctions on Presidential advisor Kudakwashe Tagwirei and his company, Sakunda Holdings, calling the Zimbabwean businessman and political operator, Tagwirei, \""notoriously corrupt.\"" Mike Pompeo said the United States wants \""a stable and democratic Zimbabwe. Our actions today demonstrate to the government and people of Zimbabwe that the United States does not tolerate public corruption and will promote accountability for perpetrators of public corruption.\"" Music to the ears of many a South African? However it is clear the USA simply does not understand that to Africans, corruption is endemic and bribes and kickbacks are another word for \""patronage\"" to them. The reaction by Zimbabwe?s Acting Information Minister, Sithembiso Nyoni, who also happens to be on the sanctions list, speaks volumes to this: \""As Zimbabweans we have got to trust the deficit between our people and government. I think we need to trust each other to be patriotic. There?s nobody who doesn?t know how the sanctions came, and that it is usually some of us not necessarily government who go out there and talk ill of their own nation. I think it is incumbent upon all of us as citizens of Zimbabwe to defend our own nation\"" ? but when it comes to dishing out loot amongst themselves and their cronies, where is the trust and patriotism then? Happy to steal from the people, but when the buck stops, they suddenly call on the people? The statement by the US State Dept. talks about when Zimbabwean authorities launched, what he refers to as a violent crackdown two years ago, against citizens who were protesting flawed elections, referring to the July 30th 2018 elections. The same government has yet to hold anyone accountable for the six protesters who were killed that day, and to mark the anniversary of their deaths today, the United States is taking action to fight corruption in Zimbabwe, by adding businessman and adviser to the President, Kudakwashe Tagwirei ,who they describe as a notoriously corrupt Zimbabwean businessman, to the Sanctions list, which includes about 80 Zimbabwean individuals, about three pages long, including the former president Mugabe and Grace Mugabe. Lifting these restrictions on Zimbabwe, will only occur when the United States is satisfied with the restoration of the rule of law in Zimbabwe, including aspects like freedom of speech and association, which is a big conversation point in Zimbabwe right now, after the incarceration of journalists, and people that are in hiding or the opposition in Zimbabwe, and it calls for an end to lawlessness and violence and intimidation.",sa-news,0
"\""Rooi Gevaar\"" Using Corruption to Oust Ramaphosa! Axis of Evil Blaming Cyril for \""Mass Epidemic of Looting\"" Because \""He Did Not Act\"" Against Them!","Communists are masters at the dark art of subterfuge and obfuscating blame, accountability and punishment, and it now seems that the Axis of Evil (ANC, COSATU & SACP) are blaming Cyril for all their corruption & failures! They want Ramaphosa out, because NDZ & COSATU have joined forces with alliance partners, the SA Communist Party (SACP) and SA National Civic Organisation (SANCO), in pushing for the reconfiguration of the ANC-SACP-Cosatu-Sanco alliance, to get Communists as national leaders. COSATU general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said the future of South Africa must be in socialism, not capitalism. Coved-19 corruption has become the latest ANC scandal, with public claims of corruption relating to the procurement of PPE in the last couple of days, suggesting that these corruption claims are the result of Ramaphosa?s failure to act against corruption. There are claims it is his responsibility to take action because they backed him at NASREC in the ANC conference. There you have it, their corruption is now his fault because they backed him! Like children, literally blaming the Mother for not admonishing them! COSATU?s Parliamentary Coordinator, Matthew Parks made a scathing attack against Ramaphosa, saying the extent of corruption in our society and in government is so bad, we have to tackle it head-on! He said corruption is a national cancer and ANC have not managed to make significant inroads against it. The scandals around the PPE are only the tip of the iceberg and are symptomatic of a very sick state. A sick society, a sick political elite and ANC government has to act more decisively. Mathew said at the end of the day, the buck stops at the President (The one they want out). Mathew continued that Ramaphosa appoints the leadership of the National Prosecuting Authority, of the South African police service and he has to hold them accountable. The public at large are sick and tired of this constant scandal of looting and it has a direct impact upon workers. For instance when providers provide poor quality masks, that results in the death of nurses and doctors, who are now being hit by Covid-19 infectious at the hospitals, when they should have been protected with decent quality masks. It means clothing workers lose their jobs when corrupt politicians and their families and friends rush to import cheap masks from China, instead of buying it locally, which could have helped save the economy. It means public servants are not going to get the inflation wage increase, because the state is bleeding 10% of it?s budget every year to a mass epidemic of looting and wasteful expenditure. COSATU must hold Ramaphosa?s feet to the fire, because he has to act move decisively. The public support the president but their patience is not unlimited and there is a deep deep kind of corruption within the ANC, within Ramaphosa?s cabinet, within government, and we need to start seeing politicians being thrown in prison. We?ve only seen one provincial MEC, John Bloch wind up in prison, but can we see one politician going to prison every week? That will start giving people a sense of hope that something is being done to eradicate this corruption, because there?s no way that you can expect to get international investors to come and invest in South Africa, if we are looting it. ANC is asking people to donate their wages to the Solidarity Fund and people ask why, you?re allowing politicians to loot it? There?s a direct correlation ? Ramaphosa really has to crack the whip and start throwing these people into prison, it is simply inexcusable to have this frenzy of family and friends of the elite, looting left right and center, and then nothing is done about it. ANC need to tighten the regulations for example on PPEs, they need to decentralize procurement and national treasury and to remove that competency from provincial and local government. They need to start holding politicians and the management of these institutions to account. If a MEC under his department has failed, they must fire the MEC, they must fire the senior management. Those are the kind of political innovations they can start doing. It is not just a question of COSATU being angry and changing slogans, you simply have to look at the auditor general?s report which is a damning picture every year, about the state of mismanagement in government, and the looting. Nothing has been done ? no Mayors have been removed, no municipal managers have been removed. The auditing act empowers the state now to go and freeze the assets of managers who are corrupted. The president can go and tell the NPA head, if you don?t start attacking corruption, if we don?t start seeing those implicated in these scandals being tried and convicted, I will remove you. He can do the same thing to the police commissioner, hold them accountable because they?re not there doing us a favor, they are there to serve the public and right now they?re failing the public. There are local elections next year and the ANC is going to pay dearly. But, will SACP contest it on their own, instead of riding on ANC?s now very dirty coat tails? ",sa-news,0
"Ramaphosa Cares More For Vicious Farm Attackers Than For Their Victims! Farm Attacker & Kidnapper Released with 19,000 Prisoners!","Ramaphosa told Bloomberg News in New York in 2018 that there are no farm murders in South Africa ? he has never withdrawn his statement. We should not be surprised then, that he cares more for farm attackers than for their victims! One of the 19,000 prisoners released by Ramaphosa, because he was concerned they would get the CCP-virus in prison, was involved in the brutal farm attack on Daleen van der Hoven (80) of Zastron on 3 July. She was beaten over the head with an iron implement, abducted and left for dead in the freezing mountains. As we reported, Daleen was alone in the farm house that night because her son was out on business, and the attackers who apparently knew she would be alone, beat her over the head with an iron implement, despite the fact that she is an 80 year old, harmless frail female and they were 4 attackers or is that hyenas? They robbed family jewelry, cash and 2 rifles and then abducted Tannie Daleen in her own vehicle. She was callously dropped in the mountains on the Lesotho border, at night in the bitter cold, without her glasses and shoes, clearly left to die. She manage to reach a hut and knocked on the door of the hut, and the people in the hut helped her and gave her blankets. They also called a farmer on the South African side of the border who came to fetch her. She was recently discharged from hospital after a long stay, but had a setback and had to go back to hospital after she could not do certain tasks. She was healthy before the attack. A procedure was done to drill a small hole in Tannie Daleen?s skull on Monday so that liquid could be drained. She is currently in the High Care unit of the hospital. We hope and pray this does not become a murder case, because the attacker would be long gone!",sa-news,0

As expected, this has led to unhappiness amongst his ex team mates from the team that won the 95 World Rugby Cup, which resulted in a heated debate between Pienaar and others on the 1995 Boks? WhatsAPP group. Francois Pienaar ended up leaving the group, but was followed out by the likes of Joel Stransky, Christiaan Scholtz, former manager Morné du Plessis and former SA Rugby CEO Edward Griffiths, although it is not clear for what reasons they left, or white side of the fence they came down on. Some of Pienaar?s former teammates however criticised him and are angry at him, because they feel that through his actions, they are now also associated with the far left Black Lives Matter stigma. They wanted to make it clear that he was doing this without their approval or agreement. So obviously throwing a black power sign and kneeling is simply trying to win acceptance by people who he wants to come and spend money at the tournaments for the game he is a shareholder in. But how can you go in front of the BLM grouping ? which is a radical left wing, bible burning Marxist, revolutionary, and extremely anti white anarchist group, allied with antifa and muslim brotherhood, who act like self appointed gods, that you need to kneel down to? They are NOT GOD. Yes, they are actually burning Bibles and the US Flag at rallies. Is Francois Pienaar now an anti white, anti american, anti police, atheist? What BLM are is a black supremacist, world revolutionary movement that seeks to cancel any form of identity and nationhood that white peoples of the world might still have. These BLM people, or rather their globalist controllers like George Soros and Council on Foreign Relations (CoFR), hate whites and plan our demise to make us white people minorities all over the world, by implementing a borderless New World Order, which will be led by the Elites like George Soros and other Leftists and Deep State Globalists like the American Democratic party and others that Soros is currently funding. They want to remake the world in their image. Just observe what they do and your eyes will open. They want to take away borders and even defund Police so their will be no law and order. Don?t be \""useful idiots\"" for these globalists . They have always envisioned the BLM movement as their storm troopers. Clearly Francois has other reasons as the ones he gives for falling on his knees. He says he did it because he is against discrimination of all people. He lied. BLM discriminates against whites. BLM is exclusive. Everyday there is black against white murders and violence in South Africa like the slaughter of the Brand family. BLM and the people who kneel before them never say anything about that. White lives do NOT matter to them. White people in South Africa are the most discriminated group in the world, with all the legislation stacked against us. BLM never says anything about that. The Pienaars and his ilk are liars, because surely they do know what is happening around them. Today, South Africa is the most racially regulated country in the world with The ANC discriminating against whites in each and every sphere of life in the new South Africa. Whites can?t even get food parcels or financial help packages from the state for those whose businesses which had to close during the lockdown, so even pandemic help is based on race in South Africa. Whether you want to study, work, play sport, apply for financial help to study, do business or apply for promotion, your race as white person will be used to discriminate against you and that is a fact. In fact the ANC is ramping up BBBEE and other social engineering laws! This type of BEE as implemented by the ANC is making hospitals unsafe, make State Owned Enterprises bankrupt, put the lights off and cause water shortages etc, not to mention cause the country to be looted empty. So wake up from your bubble Francois and friends and admit you are just useful idiots for the Leftists and Globalists, just so that you can line your own pockets?",sa-news,0
"Ubuntu, Like BLM is an Invented Lie! Africa\""s Real Values are Violence, Burning, Looting, Selfishness & Now Entitlement Too!","Locals have set the Catherine Booth hospital in Amatikulu, Eshowe, which was helping in the fight against Covid-19, ablaze again! It was recently rebuilt at a cost of R6 Million after it was also burnt down 3 years ago! Why do Black South Africans constantly destroy their own hospitals and schools? Do Black Lives Not matter to blacks? Where is the Ubuntu they always brag about? Seems like BLM & Ubuntu are just a political scam and an agenda aimed at extracting unfair advantage to get free stuff, to feed the sense of entitlement that progressiveness has radicalised them with, for its global domination agenda. The ANC?s MEC for Health in Kwazulu-Natal (KZN), Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, is of the opinion that it is because locals are unhappy that people are being treated for the CCP-virus in the hospital. Others say it was disgruntled contractors? Did they burn it down so they could get another Tender and get paid another R6 Million to build a new hospital, and when that is finished, they burn it down again so they can get another tender? Just imagine the values! However this should not surprise us. Between 1983 to 1987 black ANC activists burned over 700 blacks alive, half of them with Winnie Mandela?s necklace! It appears liberals doth protest too much, in order to over compensate and hide the fact that Africans are constantly demonstrating that Black Lives do NOT Matter to blacks, as not a day goes by without a hospital, school, municipal building, bus, train or whatever being burnt down and destroyed. #TheAfricanWay is to destroy exactly that which will empower and free you. A whole hospital burnt down just because there are 3 CCP-virus positive patients being treated there in an isolated ward. Incidents like this are common place in South Africa where hospitals, schools and other infrastructure are burnt down on a regular basis. What this shows, is that Africans don?t have the same values as other nations, because everywhere else in the world, people believe in building and caring for each other, but in Africa they believe in burning, looting, stealing and destroying, the very things that they beg for and that could help them. Blacks have been looting, burning and stealing from hundreds of schools during the lockdown. This is barbaric and uncivilized behaviour, but liberal media will never call it that, because it doesn?t fit the liberal left media?s agenda to paint everything white as bad and everything black as good. The liberal media will never try to protect the white minority in South Africa, they have been ignoring the farm murders and other black on white violence for a long time. They also have not been criticizing the ANC?s social engineering and racist BBBEE laws designed to drive black hegemony. According to new proposed enhancements to the BEE legislation, people running their own businesses will now be forced to employ 90% black people, even in the Western Cape where the population is 70% white and brown. The liberal media deliberately looks the other way when it comes to the oppression of minorities in South Africa, because making money from the black majority is more important to them, as minorities are forced out of the job market through social engineering laws. The liberal media is driving a deliberate false narrative in South Africa and the world by leaving some facts out, like the black on white violence. When they report about crime, they leave out the race of the suspect. Blacks in South Africa can get away with everything today and not be held accountable because the media treat them with kid gloves. The media throughout the world is deliberately self censoring and infecting each other to do so, because it is seen as politically correct. Double standards have become a way of life to them in the process, otherwise it is quite difficult for them to maintain their political correctness. But who is it that determines what is politically correct? Well one of these social engineers is George Soros, because he funds radical left political activists like antifa all over the world, to the tune of billions. It is Soros and his friends in Hollywood who determine what is politically correct in the world today. We should not allow them and stop turning the other way. In fact if we really believe Black Lives Matter, we should be shouting out louder about this hypocrisy and the barbarism that blacks perpetuate. ",sa-news,0
"SAPS Refused To Search For Missing Murdered Family! SABC & News24 Cover for SAPS Evil Malicious Negligence, Exposed by International Media Coverage!","Lying by Omission: As details of the brutal triple farm murder emerge, even making international news headlines, because the mother Breggie (Hybrecht) Brand was originally from UK, where the Mail Online reported on the horrendous story, revealing something mainstream media in SA are covering up: the fact that SAPS Hartswater refused to go searching for the missing family for a whole day, despite desperate pleas from their son, until the next day when family and friends managed to get to the farmhouse. Could the family had been saved if SAPS has acted when called upon? The South African Police Service (SAPS), of which many officers are \""Cadre Deployment\"" placements ? ANC voters rewarded for their loyalty to the party, with cushy jobs, irrespective of qualifications or experience, refused on Sunday to investigate and search for the missing family, Danie and Breggie Brand, as well as their daughter Elzabie, in the country?s remote Norther Cape province. The couple?s son phoned the Hartswater police in vain, who stubbornly refused to send anyone out. Only when volunteer groups complained to a high-ranking officer, and pressure was exerted through the media, did the police service finally send officers to the crime scene. News24 reports that \""Later that Sunday afternoon, family members had tried to reach the three ? and when they could not, had raised the alarm.\"", but no mention that this was by phone, and they are very vague about the timeline and cleverly use the \""Sunday Lunch\"" still being on the table, to create the impression it was on Sunday that \""help\"" had arrived there: \""When the first help had arrived at the farm, the Sunday lunch still stood on the family table ? untouched.\"" No mention that this was Monday though? Why are they covering up for SAPS? Is this not their job as \""independent\"" media to be honest and critical? SABC News reports are also very vague talking about afternoon and evening events, but not mentioning the day, but being the ANC mouthpiece we can expect them to cover up deliberate and malicious negligence by their owners, the state. Only Netwerk24 reported that people arrived at the couple?s home the next day on Monday afternoon, only to find it deserted, ransacked and bloodstained, but they are charging people to read the story behind a paywall. Only then, after the relatives raised the alarm on Monday again, was Daniel?s Nissan Micra found close to Taung and Elizabeth?s Mazda was spotted driving on false plates at Pudimoe, 30 miles further along the N18 from the family?s home. Joseph Renaud, Afriforum community safety head for the Central region, said in a statement that it was Afriforum?s local neighbourhood watch who spotted the car and alerted Police, who then pulled the car off. A woman (42), was arrested on Monday night when she was found driving the stolen silver Mazda, along with two young men aged 18 and 19. A fourth young man, aged 20, was also arrested shortly afterwards. Two of the gang members pointed out the rough area where they had dumped Elizabeth and told police her mother and father were left hanging dead from a tree nearby. A spokesman for Afriforum, the pressure group highlighting the murders of those on farms and smallholdings, called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to ?wake up? to the killings. Ramaphosa has infamously denied the existence of farm murders to international news media on various occasions, home and abroad. Marius Muller confirmed the timeline and said: \""The fears of relatives that all three had come to harm was reported to the local police station on Sunday but it appears that absolutely nothing was done about it.\"" \""It was only when those worried relatives traveled down on Monday themselves, that they found effectively a crime scene with the house ransacked and the blood stains inside.\"" \""You can only image the terror these poor people went through in their last hours and there was no need to kill them. They could have just robbed them if that was what the motive was.\"" \""Who knows if the police acted immediately on Sunday then lives could have been saved? Those who run this country have to wake up to what is happening and protect farmers.\"" Father-of-three Daniel, known as Danie, and his wife Hybrecht, who was known as Breggie, ran a water production scheme in Hartswater where they supplied the water to the local area. Hybrecht went to The Grove School in Milton Keynes but moved to South Africa after she finished her education. Elzabie went to stay with her parents in Hartswater after her divorce. Wikus Taljaard told News24 his in-laws were a \""religious\"" family, and cared deeply for their surrounding farming community. Recently, his father-in-law had taken an elderly retired farmworker to hospital for treatment, and spent the day by his side. \""These are good people, lovely people ? they have been doing so much for the community,\"" Taljaard said. Recently, however, their miniature Doberman pinscher had been killed ? around two weeks ago. \""My Dad said it was a snake ? but it?s quite cold for snakes in winter, isn?t it?\"" speculated Taljaard. Dan and Breggie leave their daughters Heidie from Branckenfell and Trudie de Beer from Potchefstroom. The ANC/EFF have painted a target on the back of a minority group and now we can see the results. Senseless hate crimes like this. Whole whites families have been wiped out by black attackers time and again, scores of white children have been killed by black attackers and countless white women raped by black attackers before. But many choose to ignore and forget. We asked so many times that people must not forget and ignore, yet they did, because it was not their family. Well Dan and Breggie Brand and their daughter Elzabie is our family, because if you look into their faces, you will recognize your mother, father, grandmother or grandfather or a sister or brother. They are us. An attack on one is an attack on us all. ",sa-news,0
Zimbabwe Forced To Pay $3.5 Billion Compensation To White Farmers Mugabe Evicted! Has To Borrow The Money on International Bond Markets!,"Ramaphosa Thinks He is Cleverer Than Mugabe? Zimbabwe has been forced to pay a historic USD $3.5 Billion to white farmers that black Zimbabweans, encouraged by Mugabe, had attacked, killed and evicted from their farms. The deal has been signed by Zimbabwe?s new government to compensate about 4,000 of the country?s white commercial farmers who were evicted from their land two decades ago. Sadly this will not bring the slaughtered farmers back, but how about a public apology and a warning to SA too? The compensation agreement comes as the southern African nation?s economy is still struggling with rock bottom food production and export income, which resulted from the killing and eviction of their white commercial farmers. Zimbabwe has had to raise a loan on the international bond markets over 30 years to raise the money for the compensation, making the persecution of white farmers even more costly. However once again, it is the usurers, moneylenders and globalist money power reaping the profits. Indeed for an african nation to persecute its white farmers is suicide and Zimbabwe has only just survived, but will South Africa learn its lesson? Apparently not, the ANC is even denying farm murders take place and have a program for \""Radical Transformation\"" to expropriate white owned land without compensation! Zimbabwe is battling inflation of more than 700 percent, besides dealing with shortages of currency, fuel and food, while over 90 percent of the population is out of formal employment after the \""bread basket\"" of Africa became plagued with socialist driven anti white hatred. Food production had plummeted after Mugabe?s Zimbabwean government authorized the purge of white farmers in 1999-2000. Whites comprised a tiny percentage of Zimbabwe?s population but contributed vastly to the income, economy and food security of the country from which everyone benefited. In an effort to get more blacks involved in working the land, Mugabe?s government promised to redistribute the land among black farmers. However it is clear whites are more suited to being commercial farmers, something the Zimbabwean seems to have realised and now acknowledged. Mugabe was also accused of using the land reform to reward his political allies and cronies rather than ordinary Zimbabweans. The president and his supporters reportedly owned about 40 percent of the land seized from white farmers, who received no compensation after being evicted. In a socialist left wing anti white campaign the country?s rulers alleged that the land was taken forcibly during colonial times, and was used as justification for murderous attacks and evictions, as is happening in South Africa right now. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said \""This momentous event is historic,\"" as \""it brings closure and a new beginning.\"" Vice President Constantino Chiwenga said a committee had been formed by the government, farmers and donors to raise funding for the compensation. The compensation agreement is for improvements and assets on the more than 4,000 farms that were seized but it doesn?t pertain to the land itself, according to Ben Gilpin, a director of the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU), which represents the white farmers. CFU President Andrew Pascoe said at the signing ceremony on Wednesday that \""today marks a huge milestone,\"" adding: \""As Zimbabweans, we have chosen to resolve this long-outstanding issue.\""",sa-news,0
Fake News News24 Calls Triple Farm Murder a Farm Attack! Is it Deliberate? Are NASPERS Too Scared To Admit Ramaphosa is a Liar?,"No Such Thing as Unbiased Media: There is nothing more horrific and evil than a family being violently kidnapped and murdered, yet News24 seem to be doing their level best to make it appear like a minor domestic crime, to avoid telling the world that Ramaphosa is a liar! Having updated their report, AFTER all 3 bodies of the MURDERED FAMILY in Northern Cape had been found, they still called it an ATTACK on PARENTS in their misleading headline, despite including a Tweet in their updated article, which specifically upgrades the incident from an attack to a Farm Murder! News24 deliberately avoided using the words \""Farm Murder\"" and \""Family\"" in their headline! Here?s why: The general news reading public are not aware of all the nuances that mainstream media use to sway public opinion and manufacture the narrative. Firstly, just the headline is repeated in all the news feeds and tweets around the globe, and that is all that most people read. Yet even the next day, NEWS24 was still telling the world it was only a farm attack and only the parents bodies were found? News24 lies It is almost certain News24 did not change the headline because of the headline?s broad global exposure in millions of newsfeeds, and the reporters are certainly fully aware of the difference between a Farm Murder, and a Farm Attack, and the political ramifications thereof! They added the word \""Update\"" to the headline, so why not update the headline itself? Are News24 too scared to openly admit Ramaphosa is a liar in their news headlines, which is repeated in millions of news feeds across the globe? To be clear, had the races been reversed, News24 would have been all over every detail, letter and nuance of the story, so even if they admit it was an oversight, that would be an admission of bias and negligence. Indeed Naspers is so desperate to control the narrative, and profit from people?s misery, that they have previously threatened SA-News with lawsuits for publishing information on farm murders, which they claimed to own! Caxton Press did the same. Mainstream media like News24 subtly twist everything, from using a picture of a white person when a black person committed the crime, to omitting important facts like the race of the perpetrators, even when law enforcement is hunting a suspect, to downplaying the crimes with subtle wordplay, as in this case. Remember Ramaphosa emphatically stated to the world that there are no farm murders in South Africa, so if News24 use the word farm murder in their headline, they would be telling the whole world Ramaphosa lied. Brand family farm murder The general news reading public is also not aware of certain words which the Socialist mainstream media deem politically incorrect, and are to be avoided at all costs. One of these words is \""family\"". Believe it or not, some far left LGBT groups have even tried to have the word \""family\"" declared hate speech, because it excludes their deviancy! (Gays cannot have kids). As a result, the far left has constantly pushed the narrative that a single person and a cat are a family, in order to defuse the traditional definition of a family, and the wholesomeness it implies. Are they trying to confuse this murder of a family with domestic violence headlines? Feminism vs family Elderly Danie Brand(83), his wife Breggie(73), and their daughter Elzabie(54) who was visiting, had been brutally murdered with a crowbar. The brutal murder came to light on the afternoon of Monday 27th July at around 17:00 when friends of the Brand family at Hartswater, in the Northern Cape, found nobody home and became suspicious when they noticed the house was ransacked with blood allover, and the family?s vehicles also appeared to be missing. They had phoned earlier and were worried when nobody answered, so they went to investigate, and realized something horrible was wrong, and a desperate search for the family was launched, with a crucial arrest later that evening, from where the gruesome events of the triple murder on Sunday unfolded. Elzabie Brand was visiting her parents over the weekend and luckily her missing car was recognized on the N18, just past Pudimoe. The suspects had replaced the vehicle?s number-plates, which implies a certain sophistication not normally credited to barbaric farm murderers. According to the Community Safety Unit, four suspects have been arrested and questioned. The suspects pointed out to the police where Elzabie?s body could be found in the vicinity of Buxton near Taung against the Ghaap?s mountain. However, the area is extremely rugged and the terrain is difficult to navigate, so drones were used to search the area the following morning, and the bodies of the victims were eventually located, hidden under some bushes.

ANC Cadres Score R70 Billion No Strings Attached IMF Loan That YOU Have to Pay Back!,"Communists Love Spending Other People?s Money: Even though corrupt ANC has steered clear of IMF loans thus far, because they require financial transparency and discipline, the COVID-19 pandemic and Black Privilege has allowed the ANC government to get a loan, without an IMF structural adjustment programme, despite the IMF being deeply suspicious of ANC and COSATU. Seizing the opportunity the Corona Virus has afforded them, the ANC grabbed 100% of South Africa?s IMF quota. The IMF loan amount of $4.3 billion (R70.6 billion) is allegedly to help mitigate the adverse socio-economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, however it is unlikely that that is where the lion?s share of the relief package will go, as the IMF is \""respecting\"" the ANC?s decisions on how best to provide relief for the economy, and ANC gets to decide who is worst affected by the current crisis. So ANC cadres score big once again. The ANC government had made it clear that they do not want an IMF structural adjustment programme, despite the IMF?s deep suspicion of the governing African National Congress (ANC) party and the influential trade union movement that the ANC allies itself with, because of the possible austerity conditions of such a programme, making it harder for systemic ANC corruption. IMF?s naive First Deputy Managing Director Geoffrey Okamoto stressed there is a pressing need for the ANC government to \""strengthen economic fundamentals and ensure debt sustainability by carrying out fiscal consolidation, improving the governance and operations of state-owned enterprises and implementing other growth-enhancing structural reforms.\"" But that was all brushed aside as Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni said in a statement after the IMF announcement, \""Going forward, our fiscal measures will build on our policy strengths and limit the existing economic vulnerabilities which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,\"" In other words, ANC gets to continue its criminal enterprise, while we pay. The IMF said this Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) loan was equal to 100% of South Africa?s IMF quota, and will also pave the way for ANC government to push ahead its radical transformation programme and provide necessary finances required to forge this new all black economy which Ramaphosa has slated. The corrupt ANC government plans to borrow around $7 Billion from international financial institutions in our name, allegedly to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19 and help struggling businesses and households? and themselves. Of that $7 billion, the New Development Bank of the BRICs nations ? of which South Africa is a member ? has already approved a $1 billion loan, and the African Development Bank has said it will lend the government roughly 5 Billion Rand ($304.55 million). Meanwhile talks with the World Bank are ongoing as ANC plunge SA deeper into the hole of international debt slavery ? just how the globalist usurers like em?

"No School, Alcohol or Family Visits  Just Protests, Full Taxis & Crime! CCP-Virus Perfect Tool for Socialists to Destroy Economy & Society!","Ever since the arrival of Covid-19 in South Africa, the country has more and more resembled socialist Cuba or Venezuela, where everyone is on government grants, the government controls everything and the zombie citizens are radicalised in an eternal \""revolution\"" against their own prosperity. SA has literally devolved into a country littered with criminals and eternally disgruntled protesters, militarized on a local level by ANC structures, to supposedly show their displeasure over anything the local leaders choose to highlight, because none of this is about the people or services, it is all about the leaders and what they stand to gain. A good example is Ramaphosa?s announcement that cabinet had decided to close schools for a month, which was actually Cabinet capitulating to the pressure exerted by trade unions. The battle between the Minister of Basic Education and the Trade Unions ended this time in favor of the trade unions. Likewise the battle against Covid-19 is being severely hampered by the socialist trade unions as they jockey for power and money, happy to close clinics and hospitals. Meanwhile in the Western Cape, residents of the informal settlements reacted angrily and demanded that they \""have the right to rebuild their squatter shacks\"" where the municipality had demolished them, all the while more and more of them are bussed in from the Eastern Cape, as part of a larger campaign by ANC leaders to take over the Province, so they can plunder some more. In the north, the SA Municipal Workers? Union wants to start a war against the larger Pretoria city council, because they have a dispute over salaries and the streets have been turned into a war zone again, as insurgents, brought in by full taxis, damaged municipal buildings as well as state property, while trucks were destroyed in fires. Each of the protesting marches were allowed to get out of hand and out of control, by the police who watched the vandals? protests, with apparent indifference. Ramaphosa claimed to object and warned against those who commit corruption, but the Minister of Police is silent about the vandals? destructive actions, as it seems they want to paint a negative picture of Ramaphosa?s opportunistic handling of the whole crisis, and rightly so.",sa-news,0

VIDEO: Who Holds Power in SA? A Shadow Government Run By ANCs Command Council & Police (CCP)  SAs Own CCP?,"#SACCP ? Are communist totalitarian structures secretly being put in place as a shadow parallel government in South Africa? Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ) talks in Parliament about implementing Regional Command Councils, but the video of the Gauteng Police Chief briefing reveals that they already exist and that \""zero tolerance\"" must be enforced by SAPS! What is a Regional Command Council? A clipping has also revealed that Organised Crime Units are not allowed to investigate farm attacks and murders ? why the instruction if \""There no farm murders in South Africa\""? Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma revealed a sinister \""district development model\"" when she told (not asked?) Parliament that her so called \""district development model\"" should be implemented as soon as possible, and that they will apparently be based on the national CCP-virus Command Council she heads, and which has allocated dictatorial powers to themselves, superseding the Cabinet and Constitution of the country. It appears these structures already exist? This so called district commanders plan, which means that ministers and deputy ministers will be allocated districts to supervise on top of their current work, is very similar to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government structure in China and sounds extremely sinister and something out of a George Orwell manuscript. It appears to be the brainchild of Dr. Twak and she is justifying the plan with some very sinister sounding words, which sound like yet another gigantic social engineering plan, to hide and justify their plundering and looting schemes ? same as CCP in China. Dr. Twak says the district commanders plan is aimed to \""rectify social inequalities\"" but is this a plan to ensure all people should be equally poor and miserable, like what has happened all over the world, and all over Africa, wherever Communism or Socialism was implemented? Dlamini-Zuma told Parliament Wednesday that the district commanders model will be aimed at tackling \""racial, gender and income inequalities through the better integration of local government planning\"". Apart from its ominous implications, what the heck does this even mean? Is this the start of ideological re-education centres like China employs to effect ethnic cleansing of minorities? If the video does not load, watch it here: https://youtu.be/iDRj5EPZsiQ Furthermore, there is no minister or deputy minister capable of doing even their own work, and now they still want to be district commanders on top of that? Do they think that cabinet members are all little supreme leaders who will magically lead all districts to some communist utopia? Dr Twak is the minister overseeing municipalities and municipalities are in total shambles with 80% of them being bankrupt! She can?t even do her own job and her handling of lockdown regulations was also bizarre, with thousands of pages of ridiculous micro managing regulations. The ANC at one stage said you could only exercise for two hours early in the morning and they also sought to ban the private distribution of food. NDZ also implemented a smoking ban although cigarettes are still being sold, although now just illegally by smugglers allegedly linked to her and her son. Despite this ban, a study that just came out proves that people are not smoking less, nor have people stopped smoking. She seems to be a wannabe social engineer, classic socialist tendencies, but everything she attempts ends in spectacular failure. She is becoming more weird and ridiculous by the day, and the only possible explanation for her weird conduct is that all these sinister plans are designed as looting schemes, like the ones for which her ex husband Ja-Kop Zuma became famous for.

Mandelas Province Never Prepared for COVID-19 Storm! Eastern Cape ANC Officials Too Busy Rigging Tenders!,"Black Lives Do Not Matter To ANC: As South Africa hits its highest ever single daily death toll of 572 deaths in one day, it is clear ANC squandered the money, time and powers they were granted, and the lockdown was just a farce and pretense at preparing. Nowhere is this truer than in Nelson Mandela?s home province of Eastern Cape which has 17% of COVID19 cases, but 23% of the deaths. However we cannot be certain, as an Eastern Cape Health official admitted they do not even have reliable stats to work on, but most South Africans had already deduced this. All that matters to ANC officials is stealing as much money as they can, as fast as they can, for as long as they can! In the Eastern Cape, like everywhere else, Mandela?s ANC maliciously punished people for months by keeping them locked up in their houses, prohibiting people from walking on beaches or in nature, prohibiting people from smoking or a glass of wine, destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs during their hard lockdown. The rationale for all this punishment and destruction of the economy and people?s livelihoods, was allegedly that hospitals should be given time to prepare for the CCP-virus, obtain enough equipment, beds and personnel. Well guess what. The health department in the Eastern Cape did NOT prepare and they did not obtain enough beds or equipment, or anything else. They did not prepare. Imagine that. All the punishment and destruction of jobs were all for nothing. ambulance scooter chinaWhat they did do however, was abolish proper tender procedures, for instance to buy rickety Chinese scooters with a side span and thin mattress on it, to transport people to hospital on the province?s atrocious rural roads. These did not meet the basic criteria as an ambulance, and having been caught out, Mkhize now admits they were never intended to replace ambulances, but these scooters are unusable, and the money is long gone. With the DA demanding that the Eastern Cape be put under administration, the ANC government admitted in Parliament yesterday that Eastern Cape hospitals are in chaos. The chairman of the government task team for the province, Sibongile Zungu, admitted in Parliament that the province?s health department does not even have any kind of reliable stats to work on. There are no CCP-related stats for Northern Transkei because officials there are simply not capable of doing this task. Likewise, the amount of CCP-virus related deaths for Nelson Mandela Bay has not increased the past 2 weeks, something which is highly unlikely. It means they cannot count or they are keeping deaths quiet. Given the financial incentives to report more Covid19 cases, for more cash, the former is more likely. The provincial health department also did not establish a field hospital. The only field hospital was established by Volkswagen in Uitenhage. All the provincial government did was give it a name. Zungu now wants the DA run Western Cape, which has far more cases, to take EC patients because the totally unprepared and ruined EC health department has run out of beds and personnel, and they are unable to treat CCP-virus patients. It was also clear from early on that it was almost impossible to get \""our people\"" in the provinces to isolate and social distance. The health department clearly did not prepare but rather went about their normal lazy routine of lining their own pockets and feeding at the trough, unconcerned. Now the CCP-virus storm is upon them and they are starting to squeal like pigs. The Eastern Cape, Mandela?s home province, is notoriously corrupt, so much so that ANC officials even stole money allocated for Mandela?s funeral, and in one of many similar corruption cases, they spent around R550 Million to build outside toilets in the amaThole district. But remember it is #TheAfricanWay, something the ANC publicly committed to.",sa-news,0
Biohazard Alert as Covid19 Virus Samples Stolen in Mandelas Sh*thole Home Province! Eastern Cape Fast Becoming Humanitarian Disaster Zone!,"Corruption Kills: A truck carrying about 40 litres of live Covid19 virus samples has been hijacked in lawless Port Elizabeth, prompting alarm about a biohazard threat to the ANC governed region, which is on the brink of a humanitarian disaster, thanks to two decades of institutional corruption, systemic and systematic plunder of taxpayers money and state coffers, malicious neglect, and racism towards competence (BBBEE). However this is good news for the ANC comrades, because that means more international bounty, cash handouts and loans, and also it allows the ANC communists to blame white people even more. The Covid-19 pandemic could not have come at a better time for the ANC to help hide their two decades of state plunder & capture. The Covid-19 virus samples were stolen in Port Elizabeth, in the Eastern Cape province, on Monday night. The region?s ANC despot, Oscar Mabuyane, spoke about the incident during his coronavirus media briefing on Tuesday, confirming that a container of Covid-19 specimens en route to a local laboratory, had been stolen at gunpoint during a hijacking. The armed hijackers robbed the driver and passenger of their personal possessions and seized the courier truck. The vehicle was found abandoned later, but the container holding about forty litres of live coronavirus samples was no longer inside. SA?s National Health Laboratory Service has warned that the samples may be highly contagious, and local authorities said that anyone who suspects they have seen the white cooler box, should report it immediately to law enforcement. It?s not clear how many hijackers were involved in the armed robbery, and Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu admitted that police currently have no suspects but the search is ongoing. Meanwhile, health officials are trying to determine exactly how many, and whose samples are missing, as a number of citizens will now have to be tested again. However this is not the first time that the plundered Eastern Cape province has been put at a biohazard risk due to the loss of Covid-19 testing kits. At the end of June, multiple containers of coronavirus samples were found by a passerby, dumped on the side of a road between King William?s Town and East London. One of the kits had been labelled for Grey Hospital in King William?s Town. Eastern Cape Health Department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said the matter was being investigated by the department as well as the National Health Laboratory Services. Don?t hold your breath though, Eastern Cape is ANC territory?",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: SA Rugby Elites Bend Their Quivering Knees To BLM Anarchists To Protect Their Fat Cat Incomes, Selling Kith, Kin & Country for Globalist Coin & False Virtue!","#FarmersLivesMatter! Faf, AB, Francois, Graeme and all the other kneeling sports PLAYERS, we see you choosing the globalist side and we thank you for finally coming out, and getting off the fence to show your true colours. You guys are 100% right, this issue has no place for fencesitters. Each and every one of us must decide where we stand, what we believe, what is important to us, and what our motives are for what we stand for. There is so much I want to shout out, but with 167 race-driven laws in our country, I dare not. Because I?m going to be in jail for sure and leave my family as vulnerable targets in a country where there is no freedom of speech, and the majority hates the minority with a passion. Is it any wonder your knees buckled and you cower for fear of being called nasty names and losing your bribe money, er sorry, sponsorships & salaries? Professional \""PLAYERS\"" like you, I realize more and more daily, have no idea what?s going on in the WORKING real world. You have no connection with the world in which we ordinary people live. Let me draw you some parallels to prove my point: What part of your \""kit\"" that you go out with on the field, did you pay for out of pocket? Maybe your underpants? Or does Jocky or Calvin Klein sponsor that too? And besides the mahala \""kit\"" you get from each sponsor, how much does that sponsor pay you to walk on the field with his equipment? As a farmer, I pay for every single small piece of tool, every implement, every injection and syringe, and thread and zinc and bolt and nut I use on my farm, out of my own pocket. There is no farmer who receives any sponsorship from any company. Believe me, it would be incredibly nice if Landini or John Deere showed up to me with a brand new tractor, dropped him off mahala on my farm and paid me to plow with him! Man, then I?m going to play nice farmer! I know that practicing professional sports takes a lot of perseverance. You have to do your part daily, gym, jog, the whole lot. And then in front of crowds and crowds of people you have to do the thing where the whole world sits and watches you and analyzes your technique, and good and bad points to the finest detail. There are many highs and lows as well with winning and losing. Everywhere you go, young guys and pretty girls want your signature, and take selfies with you, and your poster hangs in their rooms. Because we look at you on the sports fields and you give us distraction from our every day struggle to exist as workers. My day also starts early, when it is still dark and usually finishes late too. All day in the sun, like yours. With the difference that my khakis are not sold at a high price to fans in every clothing store. There is also no one who overwhelms me for selfies and autographs. Even though I help to put plates and plates of food in front of millions of people every day. As a professional PLAYER, your career is short-lived, but in those few years you PRACTICE your sport at the highest level, and you are excellently compensated for your talents. Each one of you has agents who negotiate the best possible contracts on your behalf so that after retirement, your face and weight are very valuable in the professional world. You get nice jobs as consultants, broadcasters, marketers, and apparently politicians now too. With enough money saved to at least do something going forward. You deserved it. But no one negotiates to get me the best package personally. At the bank I stand with hat in hand. At the cooperative too. And when I take something to auction, or deliver after the harvest, my crumpled hat is also still in my hand for the alms that my sweat brings me. Because I always get the lowest possible price. And I fight nature, the state, the bank and hundreds of others just to make it year after year, so I can still work on my farm next year and feed people. \""Not all lives matter until black lives matter.\"" Faf, that one was too much. Have you ever stood next to the graves of a farmer?s family tortured to death? For that family, before their death, every life of every human being in this country mattered. They worked every day in the sun, without sponsors, without agents who could negotiate the best package for them, without government support, without admirers asking for their signatures or selfies, to feed every mouth in this country. But according to you, according to everyone who climbed off the fence with you and knelt down, that farmer?s family?s life did not matter, because apparently their death is insignificant \""because black lives does not matter yet.\"" You have all had so many opportunities to kneel over farm murders, but the issue is too hot in the political debate and is going to lead to lost sponsorships? So did you climb down to the side of the fence where the money is better? Is this perhaps a case of \""not all lives matter, because money matters more\""? Either way, thank you that we WORKERS now know where the PLAYERS stand. Every time you eat that super balanced diet of yours, with all the vegetables and fruits that are so important, you may choke on the farmer?s blood that has brought it into your plate! Name withheld because there is no freedom of speech in SA & the majority hate and suppress the minority. Here is an Ex Rugby referee from Natal who posted this video on social media where he can be seen cutting up and tearing up his Springbok Rugby jersey, to protest farm murders! If the video does not load above, watch it here: https://youtu.be/RSy9BeI1GbI \""I was a Rugby referee for 15 years in Natal and I played Rugby as well (4th divs). I wasn?t very good at it but loved the game. I also loved watching rugby and supported the Boks whenever they played. But now after experiencing the fast track of referees of colour that really were not good enough, at the expense of very GOOD white referees and players, I must say that my retirement from refereeing came as a blessing. With the exclusion of Archie Sechlako who really became a friend and a very good referee and several other referees of colour, that were exceptional in refereeing, the rest was a political move of passivation by the leadership, to add and fast track individuals of colour, as a measure of protecting cosy jobs in cosy places. A move that harmed Rugby as we know it tremendously, and if coaches of clubs that spoke to me previously in private, have the guts to admit it, something could have been done at early stages to save the face of rugby in SA. I know a lot of my friends in the Rugby community will probably crucify me for saying this, but I will be tearing up all my Springbok jerseys and I will be hanging them on my front gate, in support of recognition that farm murders must be stopped. This I am doing after Siya Kolisi and other sport captains and stars supported the BLM movement of anarchists and terrorists openly. Rugby for me in South Africa? its over and watching it? Naahh, I will be utilising that time to advocate the plight of my people, the oppressed Boers?\""",sa-news,0
SA 5th Most Infected Country! All BRICs Countries in Top 5 Except China! SA & India Receive USD 1 Billion Covid Loans from BRICs Bank!,"Cases for Cash? For an 8th straight day South Africa has reported the 4th most daily new COVID19 cases (chart below) which has helped push SA into 5th place worldwide, eclipsing many countries far more populace and undeveloped than itself, like Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Mexico, etc. Even more remarkable is that 4 of the top 5 most infected countries are BRICs countries ? all of them are in the top 5 except China, where it all started, coincidence? Even though China is the most populace country in the world? Did the access and clout that Chinese citizens have in BRICs countries help spread the virus? Or does the fact that South Africa and India have received 1 BILLION dollar Covid Loans from the BRICs Development Bank explain the high figures? The Board of Directors of the New Development Bank (NDB) approved a USD 1 Billion Emergency Assistance Program Loan to South Africa last month after approving one for India earlier. While the program is allegedly aimed at supporting the ANC Government of South Africa in its efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 and reduce human, social and economic losses caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the ANC?s spin, translation and implementation of that, means almost certainly that most of the money ends up in cadre?s pockets. Indeed CCP-virus has been the biggest windfall ANC could ever have imagined! Possibly bigger than the 1994 scramble of nations to throw cash at mandela in return for false virtue headlines! The Program should contribute to providing critical healthcare resources and strengthening the social safety net in South Africa yet everyday headlines show the exact opposite happening, like the bankrupt Eastern Cape Health Department, where babies are dying due to corruption. The positive impacts should include trying to improve the resilience of public health sector and health emergency response systems, and facilitating socio-economic recovery. Expensive sounding words, which will come to naught, and our grandchildren will still be paying off these loans to China ? we have to pay but when were we consulted? Or China will claim assets in lieu? The BRICs? New Development Bank (NDB) had previously said it had disbursed a Billion Dollar emergency assistance loan to India, to help the country contain the spread of coronavirus and reduce losses caused by the outbreak beginning of May. \""The NDB is fully committed to supporting its member countries in the time of calamity. The Emergency Assistance Program Loan to India was approved in quick response to the urgent request and immediate financing needs of the Government of India in fighting Covid-19,\"" said Xian Zhu, the bank?s chinese vice president and chief operations officer. In its Statement on Response to the CCP-virus outbreak, the NDB Board of Governors welcomed the establishment of an Emergency Assistance Facility to meet the emergency needs (like luxury vehicles?) of the member countries of the Bank. Emergency loans to the member countries could be used to finance direct expenses related to the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak and provide support to governmental measures contributing to economic recovery. National Treasury welcomes the approval of the loan and together with NDB are working on final technical and administrative requirements. Final details on the loan will be published once all processes have been concluded. The NDB was established by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICs) to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects (allegedly), in BRICs and other emerging economies and developing countries, complementing the existing efforts of multilateral and regional financial institutions for global growth and development (i.e. the spread of Chinese communist influence). The NDB received AA+ long-term issuer credit ratings from S&P and Fitch and AAA foreign currency long-term issuer rating from Japan Credit Rating Agency (JCR). ",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: Dutch Group Hangs Label on Mandela Statue in Netherlands Exposing Mandela as a Murderer, Terrorist & Communist!","A Dutch / Flemish group who has been active for decades have commemorated mandela day by exposing the real mandela, which the mainstream media hides. They have asked others to do the same. They hung a banner on the statue of Nelson Mandela with a sign saying: \""Terrorist, communist, murderer!\"" Protesters from the patriotic group Voorpost have hung a sign on the statue of Nelson Mandela in Scheveningen, Netherlands in protest on mandela day. In large black letters is written \""Terrorist, communist, murderer\"" on the placard. A video from one of the members of Voorpost shows how three men attach the sign to the statue via a ladder. He says many people including mainstream media and the left worship mandela, but they hide the real truth? \""Mandela is not sacred, he was a murderer\""? he says. \""Nelson Mandela was a murderer, a terrorist and a communist, and it?s about time we started to do something about it,\"" says the creator of the video as he films the action of his associates. \""It is time for people to know that it was not a saint. Since this man was released, over 4,000 white farmers in South Africa have been killed. \"" If the video does not load above, watch here: https://youtu.be/BAZ-1lzjSKs The group put up the sign today because it is Nelson Mandela Day. On its website, the Flemish-Dutch action group Voorpost called on members to carry out similar actions in other places in the Netherlands and Belgium where statues or references to Nelson Mandela can be found. For example, the website shows that activists have also been active in Delft, Hellevoetsluis and Bergen op Zoom, among others already. Mandela's bombs \""Today I don?t mourn Mandela?s passing. Instead , today I think of the people he murdered. I think of them lying in their graves while for years he drank champagne and was fettered on the international stage as some kind of living god. I think of all the people who have died since he became president of South Africa. All the farmers, all the elderly, all the men , women and especially all the children , who died as a result of him being unleashed onto South Africa. And while the brainwashed celebrate his life and his so-called achievements, I remember that he pleaded guilty to 156 counts of public violence, including mobilizing terrorist bombing campaigns, which planted bombs in public places. Many innocent people including women and children died because of Mandela and his MK terrorists. For that he wasn?t hung by the neck until dead ? instead he was given a life sentence in jail, the biggest mistake ever made by the South African judiciary. For it gave the ANC time to white-wash his history and remake Mandela into a freedom fighter. And with the help of Communists around the Western world, the reincarnation of Mandela the freedom fighter and Black activist was achieved. I?ll remember too that he released thousands of criminals, murderers and rapists from jail every year to celebrate his birthday while president, unleashing even more violence, chaos and death on the people of South Africa. I?ll remember Mandela supporting some of the worst dictatorships and human rights abusers in the world: Fidel Castro, Qaddafi in Libya, China, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe? the list goes on. No one too evil to visit or welcome in South Africa by Mandela, yet he was celebrated as a human rights champion by the world. I?ll remember that over 100,000 people were murdered under Mandela?s presidency ? an average of 25,000 people each year. Up from 170 each year under Apartheid (1948-1989). I?ll remember that in the first four years of his presidency , the South African currency lost 80% of its value and 2.8 million working days were lost due to strikes. I?ll remember that the national debt doubled under Mandela. Yes, I will remember the failure that the man Nelson Mandela was. Not the magical myth we?re supposed to believe in. The world may have repackaged and re-branded him , but underneath he?s still the same murdering terrorist and Communist he always was.\"" If you don?t like this or are \""OFFENDED\"" by it, good!

Axis of Shame: Suicidal Lesotho Signs UN Resolution Praising China for Oppressing Hong Kong With National Security Law?,"World Domination: You would expect a tiny landlocked nation like Lesotho to be pro independence, but no, Lesotho along with Zimbabwe and Mozambique, appear to support communism and annexation. Why does Lesotho even exist? Why was Lesotho (and Swaziland & Namibia) allowed to keep its independence, but the other 10 independent bantu homeland nations were annexed by ANC in the 1994 violent coup? Why is Lesotho the favourite of UK Royals? We can only assume large amounts of money or \""deals\"" changed hands when on July 1, 53 countries (including Communist China) signed a resolution introduced by Communist Cuba at the United Nations? Human Rights Council in Geneva, praising China for the passing of the oppressive Hong Kong National Security Law. The list of those that have now became part of this new Axis of Shame (a label originally used for those supporting Chinese persecutions of Muslims in Xinjiang) has now been made public. The list consists largely of poor African and other small nations which can no doubt be bought cheaply by a superpower like China: China, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahrain, Belarus, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo-Brazzaville, Cuba, Djibouti, Dominica, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Syria, Tajikistan, Togo, UAE, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. While Russia surprisingly did not sign, its Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva issued a separate statement the day before on June 30, denouncing the \""external interference into the domestic affairs of China.\"" Chinese media also announced that some other countries also issued pro-China separate statements, including Afghanistan, Algeria, Armenia, Capo Verde, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Maldives, Nigeria, Serbia, Tanzania, Chad, Vietnam. Chinese colonialism ethiopia It seems however that these separate statements did not necessarily \""praise\"" China?s new Hong Kong National Security Law, while they criticized those \""politicizing human rights\"" and \""interfering in the internal affairs of China.\"" Meanwhile the following nations signed a counter statement introduced at the same Human Rights Council by the United Kingdom strongly criticizing China for violations of human rights and international law in Hong Kong and Xinjiang: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palau, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K. The United States did not sign because of their problems with the Human Rights Council itself, but have also strongly condemned China?s wrongdoings in both Hong Kong and Xinjiang. In the middle are those politically correct countries that did not sign either statement, including European Union countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Events like this should make people question world events and what, or more importantly who is behind them. Why were Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei, Lebowa, Gazankulu, QwaQwa, KwaZulu, KwaNdebele and KaNgwane not allowed to keep there independence and sovereignty? annexation coup There are various forces intent on world domination or increasing their sphere of influence and territory, making it clear that ending apartheid had more to do with globalisation and centralisation as well as eliminating a regional power. Racism was just a very handy and potent weapon, more potent than the 6 nukes Apartheid South Africa had developed, but had to destroy to prevent them falling into the hands of blacks ? interesting that the so called noble forces that wanted to give the country to blacks, did not want blacks to get nukes? hypocrites much?",sa-news,0
SA Now 6th Most Infected Country! Surpasses Chinas Death Toll! Herd Immunity Policy is Inevitable as ANC Unable to Control Virus Spread or its People!,"#HerdImmunity Seems The Only Option for SA Now: South Africa has had the 4th most daily new infections, for 5 straight days now (chart below), and thanks to the ANC?s inability to make coherent decisions and regulations, the Covid-19 virus is spreading uncontrolled, and has been, ever since we predicted back in February, that Africa would be the worst case scenario for the CCP-virus, for this very reason. The southern hemisphere is now clearly the epicentre with the focus starting to shift from South America to Africa, where it can spread uncontrolled due to open borders and the inability of the african population to understand, much less protect themselves from an invisible enemy, so essentially Herd Immunity reflects reality and is already being practiced. The ANC is very good at pretending and role playing, however their ineptitude and inability to govern or understand and grasp the actual problem, has been exposed by the virus, which sees right through BS. Their incoherence is seen in the recent announcement by Cyril Ramaphosa, about changes to their arbitrary regulations to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus, which will not bring about any changes in the situation. This is reflected in the peculiar measure that taxi vehicles may be 100% full of passengers at certain distances, but in other cases only 70%. Scientists believe that the 100% passengers in taxis, where everyone wears masks will not reduce the spread of coronavirus at all. Why can we not visit family with masks? This leaves the door open for irregularities and is not controllable and it appears that the ANC government is simply buckling in order to prevent confrontation. We have all seen the black masses do what they want, when they want irrelevant of any regulations. Like the virus they are uncontrollable, which is why it appears Ramaphosa?s regulations are aimed more at the minorities, as that is where the police have been concentrating their hard handed enforcement, to play their role. Given this inability to control the uncontrollable, the only option in South Africa is \""Herd Immunity\"", where the low risk people are allowed to carry on normally and get exposed to infection, and get the antibody, whilst the high risk are isolated and protected until a vaccine is found. That way those with the antibody can remain active in the economy and keep it going too. Sweden has controversially followed this route, even though they had the ability to control the spread, and is now close to zero new daily cases. Unlike Sweden, Africa, including South Africa, does not have the ability to control the spread, and they should thus be concentrating on the vulnerable, given the limited resources and lack of understanding that they have. Herd immunity is happening anyway, so they should rather embrace it and protect the vulnerable and keep the economy open! Ironically it seems government policy is to do the exact opposite, shut down everything and in hospitals where there is a shortage of ventilators, only those without comorbities are being given the life saving ventilator, whilst the weak and vulnerable are left to die? #TheAfricanWay Likewise scientists say the ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages, that has now been re-introduced will also not reduce the coronavirus infections, and new measures that are meaningful and reflect reality should rather be applied instead. The strong police action against people who drink too much alcohol is the best way to solve crime-related problems according to some. Top 3 Daily New Infections Furthermore, to underscore the ANC governments inability to cope with the CCP-virus, the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe, and his wife have tested positive for infection with the new coronavirus. In an official statement from the ANC cabinet, they confirmed that Mantashe and his wife had tested positive for Covid019 coronavirus and that they are currently under self quarantine at their residence, from where he believes he will be able to continue his work as minister. Gwede Mantashe Covid-19Mantashe?s infection has once again put the spotlight on the importance of the basic measures that must be applied by all to prevent the rate of spread from increasing further, but it seems they struggle with the basics even. The Deputy Minister of Social Development, Hendriëtta Bogopane-Zulu, was also positively diagnosed with Covid-19 and is in self-isolation. Zindzi mandela who died a few days ago had also tested positive. ANC?s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has thus far been self serving, disjointed, knee jerk and incoherent at best! Nature it seems will take its course, as we predicted. ",sa-news,0
ANC Corruption Killing Babies in Eastern Cape! Officials Should be Charged with Murder & Treason for Plundering a National Resource!,"Has ANC?s Day of Reckoning Finally Arrived? A National Health Service is meant to be there for times of emergency and unexpected disasters. People are legally forced to pay taxes based on this premise, but ANC officials have been systemically stealing these taxes, and now that a pandemic has struck, there is no Health Service and babies and their mothers are dying. Old people are dying. People who could have been saved by simple basic procedures, are dying because the Health Service has been used for \""redistribution of wealth\"" by a black gangster elite, and plundered by these ANC criminals, who should be strung up from the nearest tree! However this criminality goes far deeper and further to the extent that we cannot even trust the statistics the disgusting ANC is putting out everyday! ALL the national enterprises, assets and resources have been robbed and plundered, to such an extent that they cannot perform the function they are meant to, even in its most basic primitive form, and even the very structures themselves have been totally destroyed, so much so that in this time of emergency, there is no leadership, no structure, no facility, no order, no process. Just local despots and Unions making it up according to where the most money can be extracted! You should be very very upset! The Covid-19 stats the ANC have been putting out with great fanfare, as if that is the only function required to combat the virus, create more questions than answers. For instance South Africa, which has now overtaken UK and Spain in total cases, actually has got only a slightly higher death?s per capita than United States, which is really quite surprising. The problems in South Africa are escalating yet we see the death rate is dramatically lower, despite the significant healthcare problems of a third world Socialist country, so we should not accept these figures. The South African death figures being as low as the United States is not an accurate report and hopefully future data will clarify that as it should be closer to Brazil?s. It is so bad even the BBC reported on the crisis in the Eastern Cape. Healthcare staff are not willing to come forward so it is difficult to prepare a report, which of course is ominous in itself. Port Elizabeth and East London staff have been on various strikes at various times, and a lot of staff are off sick because they?ve caught the virus. Nurses are forced to act as cleaners, surgeons are washing their own hospital laundry and there are alarming reports of unborn babies dying in overcrowded and understaffed maternity wards. Doctors, unions and management are fighting over plundered resources, with one brave senior doctor describing the situation as \""an epic failure of a deeply corrupt system\"", with another doctor speaking of \""institutional burn-out, a sense of chronic exploitation, the department of health essentially bankrupt, and a system on its knees with no strategic management\"". One thing that really is distressing about the Eastern Cape is the perinatal deaths because these are what we might call the collateral damage of this pandemic ? a simple Cesarean section cannot even be performed, so many babies are being stillborn! People are literally dying because primary healthcare facilities, which were funded, are not available because the funds were stolen, which is very distressing. \""There?s a huge amount of fear, and of mental and emotional fatigue. We were working with a skeleton staff even before Covid-19 and now we?re down another 30%. We?ve been rudderless for some time now,\"" ? Dr. John Black Despite Health Minister Mkhize prancing around like some prince, pretending he has it all under control, the department of Health is actually bankrupt and is a system on its knees, with no strategic management, so more corruption and disorganization occurs. With all the fear, mental and emotional fatigue in the staff, services have crumbled under the strain. As SA-News predicted would happen months ago, patients have been fighting for oxygen masks, with nurses comparing it to a war situation. While blood and waste on the floors and rats is normal for a state hospital in SA, lack of personal protective equipment, oxygen shortages and also severe shortage of ambulances (the ones purchased were unusable), and patients sleeping under newspapers are making the pandemic worse, as is poor ventilation in hospitals, at a time when ventilation is absolutely pivotal in this time. A senior nurse says every day she comes to work in fear as the infection numbers go up every day. They have got chaos, disorganization and corruption. Lots of pregnant women all over the wards where mothers and infants have died. She was personally involved in the delivery of two dead infants, and there were more, which is very unusual to have several mothers and babies dying in one week, in one hospital, it is totally unheard of and unacceptable. All these babies needed was a bit of help for a couple of weeks and they could have lived a productive life for the next 80 years, but they didn?t get that chance, which is very upsetting. The fact that corruption results in the death of babies, where one person takes resources and money for their own personal greed and then children die. What greater sin than that can there be? Deaths caused by lack of basic health care due to corruption. Deliberate Negligence as SA-News has been calling it. State Capture The Billionaire?s Dance? Child birth is a dangerous time of life when you must have a medical backup for childcare. Most mothers of course will have a perfectly physiological delivery but some will not and especially in South Africa, you get a fair bit pelvic disproportion, where the size of the baby?s head is too big to fit through the birth canal. Woman will stay in labor for three or four days then eventually the fetus will be stillborn. The baby will die just through lack of a simple procedure for an obstetrician gynecologist. Cesarean sections are a very straightforward procedure and people are dying because of lack of this availability. Pregnant women waiting for days, sometimes lying in corridors waiting for urgent surgery. Staff confirm reports of an unusual number of stillborn infants in recent weeks. South Africa?s powerful yet selfish unions have been extremely active in Port Elizabeth, also trying to profit from the crisis. Laundry workers, cleaning staff, porters and some nurses have all ? at various times ? gone on strike. Sudden, union-backed, closures of smaller clinics, has driven more patients towards the city?s three big hospitals, quickly overloading them. One doctor said that \""We have seen unions shut down hospital after hospital. Each time one staff member or patient tests positive, all staff down tools. While all these union demands are being met, nothing happens? for up to two weeks.\"" The provincial health department is generally seen as inept and dysfunctional, so much so that private donors, businesses and charitable trusts, anxious to help in the fight against Covid-19, were refusing to deal directly with the health department largely because of corruption and incompetence in Eastern Cape. The president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa claimed the \""storm is upon us\"", which is patently obvious, but what is he going to do about it, and what has he and his Cabinet been doing the past five months when we knew this storm was coming? Restructuring? Seen any Cuban doctors lately? ",sa-news,0
"Video: #BLM Lied! MSM Lied! The Left Lied! Police Transcripts Expose Lies in The Official George Floyd Narrative Peddled by MSM, BLM & The Left!","No sh*t sherlock? Police transcripts from George Floyd?s arrest are exposing the lies in the official cause of George Floyd?s death. Not only was it in fact a legitimate arrest, as Floyd himself admitted he had used counterfeit bills, which is why he was stopped by the police, but he clearly could breathe, as he was able to talk. Floyd had far more than a deadly dose of fentanyl in his system and had also admitted to smuggling drugs (hooping). The transcripts which come from the body cams of two officers, have blown huge holes in the story that mainstream media and the Establishment have been pushing down our throats, to justify the crime and violence that their darling blacks have been committing in our cities and streets. We now know that George Floyd died because of his criminality, bad life choices, substance abuse and resisting arrest! We should be so outraged by this that we spill onto the streets and start burning and looting and rioting, because that is how you protest nowadays isn?t it? What is good for the goose? One America?s Kristian Rouz looks into the matter: If the video does not load above, watch here: https://www.bitchute.com/video/5bNI2jK0j6et/ However it is clear, being an election year, that the left were primed, ready and waiting for an event which they could use as a trigger to try make the country ungovernable, and make Trump look bad, and to create sympathy for false reasons. Had it not been Floyd, they would have found another black criminal somewhere to megaphone around the world?",sa-news,0
SA Has 4th Most Daily New Covid19 Cases Globally for 3rd Straight Day! But Where are the Bodies? Mojo or Fraud?,"South Africa has once again reported the 4th most daily new Covid19 infections worldwide, for the 3rd straight day in a row, confirming what Ramaphosa said, that the storm is on us. But where are the bodies? We hear anecdotal stories of hospitals running out of ventilators and ICU beds, hear of Indian nurses trying to leave the country, and of graveyards running out of space, but with all the extra Covid-19 deaths, and South Africa?s third world socialist infrastructure, you would expect to see bodies in the streets? We have had more infections than Italy, which has the same population as SA, and they literally had coffins stacked up outdoors. Fortunately for the ANC however, no one seems to be dying from heart attacks, TB, AIDS, cancer, old age, etc. anymore, so they can carry on playing their roles and pretending to be a semblance of a government. People were however dying from alcohol consumption and the accidents it causes, but the ANC, or rather the obedient us, have now put a stop to that aswell, so SA only has to worry about CCP-virus deaths and nothing else? Besides, the ANC government has had five whole months to prepare, suitcases full of cash, loyal obedient civil service and total dictatorial powers, so we should expect that they are just very efficient at processing and burying the dead right? Seriously though, it is very sad and frightening that at a time of a global pandemic, people are not even sure there is such a thing. Most people, well the reasonable obedient ones, are locked up at home and do not even know of anyone who actually got the virus. We now live in a communist police state, yet there is no visible tangible evidence of the need for it. Africans of course ignore all of this and just carry on as normal, because for all intents and purposes, everything does appear normal, except of course for the surreal dystopian perception the mainstream media, ANC government and far left wing globalists and Marxists have instilled in us. No longer can we expect to be informed of what is really going on, we should trust what the TV tells us, and that the power and authority will do what is good for all. We cannot go to a hospital or police station or municipality and ask what is the situation. Not only will they refuse to tell us and chase us away, but they probably won?t even know themselves, because they are just placeholders and minor role players in a far larger scam! Cadre employees being paid for loyalty to the party, not for labour? We are expected to follow propagandist orchestrated speeches and if we dare disobey, like naughty sub-intelligent people, we are punished, but the black masses, as usual, are untouchable. Frankly though, it seems they are incapable of caring in any case, as they pursue their subsistence hand to mouth existence, so the authorities only go after the law abiding ones, because we allow them to. Having separated ourselves from our herd, in search of consumer heaven, we are easy to pick out and harass and molest. No longer is a person trusted to do what is responsible and take care of his family and not spread infection ? they have to be forced. There is no longer an individual choice for a person to analyse and determine the risk from the virus themselves, and make a decision accordingly, but the decision is made for them and forced upon them. The biggest irony here, which will go over most people?s heads, is that it was \""individual rights\"" and \""human rights\"" which allowed the far left communists and globalists to take control of our societies in the first place, but now that they are the ones who are in power, there are no individual rights anymore? Marxism 101 Does anyone know what is actually going on?",sa-news,0
"ANC Loses Control of Covid19! SA Has Worlds 4th Most Daily Infections Despite FIVE Months Warning, Unlimited Funds & Dictatorial Powers!","Ramaphosa Can?t Bluff a Virus: With 500 infections an hour, SA has the 10th most daily deaths worldwide, despite having had 5 months warning, unlimited funds and totalitarian dictatorial powers! Ramaphosa and ANC have failed spectacularly to cope with, never mind curb, the virus. It seems the only thing they can control is the PR and propaganda to fool the people with. There is no logic and Ramaphosa blames everyone and everything but himself, despite dictatorial powers! Ramaphosa treats South Africans like naughty low intelligence children and imposed enhanced lockdown with alcohol banned again, but taxis may operate at full capacity. SA is becoming more of a madhouse by the day. By now it has to be clear to everyone that the world?s most incompetent and most criminal regime at the same time has been identified right here in South Africa. These ANC clowns have downgraded South Africa from a first world oriented country to the world?s bankrupt laughing stock. The alcohol ban shows why africans need totalitarianism with no individual rights, no individual responsibility and no individual choice ? they simply cannot be expected or trusted to act for the greater good, because they are inherently subsistence. No matter how good Ramaphosa?s act was in the speech to the country, on Sunday night, one thing is undeniable: the black majority have shown they cannot be controlled, but can only be bribed and manipulated. As usual the speech was one of those where the state run media announced before the time that they are not sure what time it will be, to create the impression that the poor Ramaphosa is inundated with work, and will fit in a news conference when he has time from urgent matters supposedly. And once again those people with an ability to analyze and think for themselves were left with mouths hanging open, in amazement at the sheer incompetence and clownery of the ANC?s CCP-virus response. Ramaphosa announced an enhanced lockdown (actually back up a level) although they pretend we are staying on Lockdown Level 3. Ramaphosa evidently decided to ? once again ? punish law abiding South Africans for the incompetence of the ANC and \""our people?s\"" lack of discipline and lack of control when it comes to the consumption of alcohol, by again banning the sale of alcohol, mere hours before the opening of business hours on Monday. Remember there are people who work in liquor stores and they are depending on that source of income to put food on the table. Ramaphosa said the consumption of alcohol places a bigger work load on hospitals because people drink and cause motor vehicle accidents. They also get in drunken brawls where they kill and injure each other, but he failed to mention that he is overwhelmingly talking about the behaviour of black Africans in townships. Why must we keep on accepting blame and punishment due to the undisciplined behavior of a certain section of the population? When it comes to blaming whites he is out front and brazen about it. No food parcels here It is clear that Ramaphosa and his ANC have lost control (if they ever had it) and are clutching at straws and making a bigger fool of themselves than they normally do. The ANC turned SA into an absurd loony farm and yet liberal media keep on cheering on Ramaphosa and his ANC, because they are themselves clowns, too busy driving the globalist/liberal political agenda, as prescribed to them by George Soros, Groundup, Bertha Foundation and other fellow liberal hacks, for them to see the bigger picture, and the surreal klepto/fascist dictatorship with which the ANC has South Africa captured. Ramaphosa has also announced that people won?t be allowed to visit family, like children and their parents, despite taxis being allowed to operate at full capacity. Why do we allow the ANC to take us for fools like this? As if all people are children and won?t be able to act responsibly if Big Nanny ANC doesn?t issue a regulation for everything? Remember that Ramaphosa initially announced the lockdown over FOUR MONTHS AGO, so that hospitals could prepare and increase ICU bed capacity. Now 108 days into the lockdown, hospitals are still not prepared and all sorts of draconian, but inconsistent, measures must still be implemented to \""flatten the curve\""? Ramaphosa also announced a curfew from 21:00 at night to 04:00 in the morning. What possible purpose could this serve? Is Ramaphosa really saying that the CCP-virus will not spread during day time in a full taxi but will spread at night? People simply have to start thinking logically and stop letting themselves be influenced by liberal mainstream media indoctrination and clichés. This is our biggest danger as a society. The problem like always is the ANC itself. We have previously reported how the ANC, ever the opportunists, have obviously grabbed the opportunity the CCP-virus pandemic brought to enrich themselves again. They have also used the opportunity to \""restructure\"" and speed up their economic racial war against the white minority by closing businesses for a prolonged period of time, without any state assistance to the white minority to keep businesses alive. One of the sectors hardest hit currently is the restaurant sector which employs many poor people, both black and white, and Ramaphosa?s continued alcohol ban will ensure another nail in the coffin of many restaurants. The ANC does not care about this industry because restaurant owners don?t threaten violence like the taxi industry do. It is not a surprise that the ANC could not get hospitals ready for the CCP-virus peak because the ANC reduced once functioning and working state hospitals to death traps over the course of it?s ruinous rule. They simply turned everything they touched into sh*t. The economy has been bleeding for a long time, municipalities are criminally dysfunctional and state owned enterprises are only looted, bankrupt shells of what they once were under white management. The ANC is totally incompetent to run a government. But how can one expect a black supremacist organized crime syndicate to successfully run a country? Instead of doing their jobs and preparing hospitals, the ANC has sought to punish citizens with draconian measures, like criminalizing everyday activities like walking on a wide open beech or even preparing peanut butter sandwiches for people. We previously reported how the Police sent a police van to close the Cradle of Hope feeding scheme in Krugersdorp. The Police even burst into the home of a white family in Middelburg, Mpumalanga to confiscate a food parcel delivered at night because the ANC basically banned the distribution of food parcels to any white families during the prolonged hard lockdown. Today we are sitting with absurd double standards such that people are allowed to attend church services and take a ride in a fully loaded taxi, but we can?t even visit our parents? This cruel ANC is not allowing us to be people anymore. They want us to be indoctrinated robots. What could be more important than family and parents? The sad reality is that the ANC is indeed able to create a pandemic of fear through liberal media collusion, causing many people to willingly give up their freedom and even rat out neighbours, who are transgressing insane ANC made laws and regulations like banning food contributions to white people in need. The DA has also pointed to the fact that the only field hospital that was set up was not done in an ANC province, but in the DA run Western Cape. The ANC has decided to destroy the economy, take away small joys like smoking and even rob us of what is most important to us, being with family, and all they could do is give us regulations and a permit system instead of what we really need. As if that will relieve them of what they are supposed to do but can?t, running a competent health system and allowing the private sector to work healthily so that people can have an income to survive. The ANC has been continually distracting, clutching at straws and moving the goal posts. They are no doubt doing it not only to hide their incompetence, but to give them more time to loot the fiscus through the issuing of tenders to cronies, speeding up their ideological slow war against the minority and speeding up their central policy framework called the National Democratic Revolution, which is based on the communist central command system. Interestingly the NDR logo appears on official Covid19 media? was it planned? Typically though, #TheAfricanWay, their trough eating mentality, leads to a fight over who must stand in line first to gorge themselves and this is manifested in the long running factional battles within the ANC, with the NDZ Zuma camp on the one side and the Ramaphosa camp on the other. It is rumoured that ANC cadres even murder their superior in order to get promoted? We should never let ourselves be deceived to think the Ramaphosa camp is so much better than the other camp. At the end of the day they are still one entity called the ANC, with the same mindset and end goal of implementing a very anti white agenda and way of thinking. Their whole departure point will always be based on self enriching and promoting a traditionalist and feudal African kleptocracy. The obedient liberal media will always be useless at pointing this out, which is why they are all going bankrupt, like the Argus, Cape Times & The Star which need to be artificially sustained by left wing funding, which comes with strings attached.

VIDEO: Lying DRAMAphosa Blames SA Whites for Domestic Violence & George Floyd! BBBEE & AA Defines South Africa & is Here to Stay!,"#AntiWhitism Not only does Ramaphosa want to break the \""natural order of things\"" like a good marxist, he has made it clear BBBEE Affirmative Action defines South Africa and is not only here to stay, but will be extended! Having been handed his billions on a silver platter, just because he is black, Ramaphosa now want to use his weaseling ability of profiteering by racebaiting, to extend the gravy train and make black privilege and black supremacy the norm in South Africa. If you are from the white, indian or coloured minority, the writing is undeniably on the wall, that you WILL be a second class citizen forever! ANC has been in charge of everything, that Ramaphosa complains about, for a quarter century, yet STILL he complains? This must be one of the most outrageous and racist things the president of South Africa has ever said. Minority white South African are actually blamed for the murder of #GeorgeFloyd and domestic violence to name a few. Clearly he has been taking extra lessons in far left wing Marxism, as he quotes the natural order of things, thereby admitting that survival of the fittest, intelligence, merit and ability should be punished. He wants to turn this around an make victimhood and laziness and lack of intelligence superior. Socialism 101. I don?t think people realize in what danger minorities in SA are in. President Cyril Ramaphosa told Freedom Front Plus leader, Dr. Pieter Groenewald that BEE is not only here to stay, but will b extended, during the President?s oral reply to questions in the National Assembly on 18 June 2020. As usual he went far into history to find his excuses for ANC inability to govern and failure to even run a country, never mind do so successfully. All the rating agencies now have SA classed as below junk status! Under lying Ramaphosa?s and ANC?s watch South Africa has dropped from first to third African economy, and violent crime has soured to one of the highest in the world! Socialism 101. If the video does not load above, watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8YSiW5umYk As was reported before, black academics are given preference in tertiary educations like Medical school. There 114 laws and regulations that exclude whites. A University official even quit and left for UK because he was constantly being harassed by ANC elites to give their children preference, with the promises he would be looked after. Besides blacks are more interested in burning down schools and universities, and the free accommodation they offer and other freebies, than actually learning or achieving. Ironically blacks also had free primary and tertiary education during apartheid, but whites had to pay, and still do, so Ramaphosa is a racebaiting lair! South Africa?s Al Sharpton! If the video does not load above, watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-27Ee8osw There is not much a University can do with a candidate who has hardly achieved the low 30% pass rate and business leaders have already complained about the quality of graduates, saying they can do nothing with them and have to retrain or rather unbrainwash them. Indeed, Universities are just bastions of marxism and Ramaphosa want to destroy, reverse the natural order of things here too! ",sa-news,0
"SA 13th Most COVID-19 Infected Country, But The Big Numbers are The Billions Sloshing Around in ANCs Hands & Pockets!","As South Africa surpasses France, Germany, Turkey and Saudi Arabia in confirmed CCP-virus cases, attention is deliberately being diverted from all the cash floating around since the ANC withdrew 500 Billion from the Taxpayer, of which 20 Billion went to NDZ?s corrupt, bankrupt, fraud infested Municipalities! While Mkhize warns that the storm is about to hit and everything from schools re-opening to mourning over deaths, supposedly from Covid-19, are being utilised to hide what is happening to all the money, which equates to over R8,000 for every single man, women and child in SA! The R500 Billion Covid Emergency Fund, which was announced by Cyril Ramaphosa in April, which is intended to help people in need due to the CCP-virus pandemic lockdown, is expected to be investigated for possible irregularities. The SA Special Investment Unit confirmed that they were tasked with investigating the Covid-19 Fund, which is believed to be subject to possible corruption and theft. As anyone who is not a biased ANC voter had already expected, there was a strong possibility that the money, which was obtained at the most expensive rates, could be looted by thieves as a chorus of protests is heard from people and institutions shouting that there is corruption, money laundering, theft and other irregularities in the Covid Fund. There are even reports that thieves have struck in various places and stole some of the Covid money, but the biggest concern is apparently about possible corruption that cannot always be detected quickly, as there is an absolute lack of transparency and the ANC cadre?s can make up any cover story they wish, without it being properly challenged and with zero accountability, due to the captured and obedient mainstream press. The Portfolio Committee on the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs has now put pressure on the concerned minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, over their share of the \""loot\"", which is R20 Billion which was allocated to the Covid-19 Municipal Fund. There is dissatisfaction with the allocation of such a huge amount of money to the municipalities who have a reputation for corruption, theft and mismanagement, yet they have to use the money to provide assistance to people at local level. Quite rightly questions have now been raised about how the R20 Billion will be administered, and opposition parties are concerned that municipalities may be able to divert and use the money for other purposes, a practice they are very experienced in. The accusation that municipalities generally have a poor track record of how money is spent, and the many times of past corruption still hanging in the air, is not without merit. In its recent report, the Auditor General indicated that only 8% of the country?s municipal authorities had a clean audit report. In the media, as well as in the social media, concerns have been raised that the money is being paid to municipalities, but that the money is not reaching the points for which it is intended. Meanwhile both Western Cape Premier Alan Winde and North West Premier Job Mokgoro have tested positive for COVID-19. Job Mokgoro was checked into hospital while Alan Winde has voluntarily self-quarantined at home. In another questionable move, SACP Secretary General and Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister, Blade Nzimande said in a briefing on Wednesday that they have reassigned R15 Million from existing indigenous knowledge projects to support Covid-19 interventions, to research \""traditional medicine\"" for the Covid-19 fight. \""We are in the process of implementing multiple interventions including the use of African medicines as immune modulators and anti-coronavirus therapeutics,\"" he said. Deaths from Covid-19 reported in the media include: AmaRharhabe Kingdom Queen Regent Noloyiso Sandile has died of Covid-19 at the age of 56. ANC KZN spokesperson and former KwaDukuza mayor Ricardo Mthembu has died after contracting Covid-19. North West MEC for Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs, Gordon Kegakilwe has died, according to Premier Job Mokgoro. ANC?s Treasurer General Paul Mashatile announced the death of his wife Manzi Mashatile, a week after he laid his mother to rest. He is going into self-isolation after a staffer in his office tested positive for Covid-19.",sa-news,0
"Will Ramaphosa Risk War for his Land Expropriation Without Compensation? Like BAV, Zulu King sees EWC as War! ANC has to Increase its Racism for Two Thirds in Parliament!","The Zulu King Zwelithini and the IFP leader Buthelezi were uncompromising over the Ingonyama Trust land?s intended expropriation by ANC, as well as their traditional leaders? land, and characterized it as a war. Just as the BAV leader, Mr Andries Breytenbach, declared on national TV (video below) on 11 October 2017, that expropriation of land without compensation will lead to war! The Zulu King has repeatedly said that the land has been in the Zulu royal lineage for centuries, and would not be taken. In addition, the Council of Traditional Leaders drew the ANC?s attention to the nearly 9.3 million hectares of land the State already owns, as well as the nearly 4,500 farms the state has on its books, and has not yet allocated. Ramaphosa promised in his state speech that 700,000 hectares of state land will be distributed (leased) this year, to the so-called disadvantaged, and so they announced last week that applications can now be submitted for the massive number of hectares, the location of which is not disclosed . \""What I want you to know about our history is that the problem we are facing now is very similar to that of our ancestors. This will be the second collision.\"" King Zwelithini at an imbizo in Ulundi in the northern parts of KwaZulu-Natal to his amabuthos (Zulu warriors). The ANC government fears that should the land?s location be disclosed in advance, blacks who did not apply, would simply unlawfully occupy the land, as is the practice these days. The applicants can submit their applications to the Department of Agriculture, but it is not known when the closing date is, or when applications will be finalized. Furthermore, some 750,000 pages of written submissions have already been submitted to the panel, so they will be processing this for years, and will not reach a decision without it! With about 8 more consultation sessions across the country, the writing is already on the wall for the ANC?s plans, and they will not be able to come to a decision to change Article 25 of the Constitution in the near future. In addition, they will have to achieve a 2/3 majority in the coming elections, in order to be able to carry it out unilaterally and for that they will have to radically increase their only way of garnering votes, radicalizing moderate blacks with anti-white racism. Another important thing they did not consider, namely the impact of the proposed Mining Charter. If they give (lease) the land to their people, for example, which takes it from the Bafokeng, they must pay millions in royalties, just like the current Bafokeng, Barolong and Boipotong tribes. So with all the tribes around the country and the coal areas in Mpumalanga, among others. The ANC will soon realize that there are smarter people among their own blacks than they thought. In addition, they are deeply in debt with their foreign bosses such as the English and Chinese, who are now demanding their pounds of flesh, following Zuma?s long-standing refusal to pay for the Arms transaction, for example. At the same time, SA is already importing foods such as wheat and chicken pieces, meat and fish from Brazil, America and Europe, etc. and we don?t have much foreign exchange left. And if SA is kicked out of the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), it will be even more expensive to import food. The state therefore raises the gasoline price, because of the debt, to get that much needed money somewhere. namely from us the citizens, with cars, trucks, tractors etc. They also know that the agricultural sector saved their bacon with the country?s National Gross Product. Without agriculture, our economy would have simply folded and our foreign debt exceeded our domestic production so much, that the World Bank would not help us. That is why they have agreed to finance the farms that will be expropriated under certain circumstances at the local banks. But it?s not just a case of taking and giving away all white land, that?s why even the World Bank doesn?t have the money. Agricultural land is, of course, more expensive than ordinary town land, although plots in cities are the opposite, and the total land under discussion by Malema includes billionaires on Cape Town?s Platinum Mile, who are rubbing their hands in anticipation of the proposed court cases involving the state. It is also a fact that 93% of blacks in SA would prefer to receive a cash amount and not a piece of land on which to farm, especially if they have no agricultural background. So, Cyril Ramaphosa knows his bluff has been called, and the world?s rich and SA?s poor, especially the rural blacks have so far sent him and Malema to a warm place over their traditional land. He knows he still has to fight with the rich, peasants, Portuguese, Greek and Jewish landowners in the courts, who will keep him and his cadres, if they ever survive 2020, busy for a while. If the video does not load above watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW273gSW0A0 Ramaphosa will also get pressure from his own ranks like the communists. The main purpose of communism is to take ownership of all food production, namely farms, into state ownership. That is why the ANC?s Freedom Charter asks for Expropriation of Land without Compensation, which is why BAV declared it a blueprint for white genocide and a declaration of war! The Freedom Charter states that \""all land must be divided among those who work it?\"" ? that does not mean it will be given to blacks. On the contrary, it is all about state ownership, and this is where the wheel falls off the wagon ? as in Zimbabwe, all the best land will be distributed to their cronies. ANC leaders repeatedly surrender to anti-white racism when they claim that white-owned land has been stolen from Blacks, but if they want to get two-thirds in Parliament, to push their plan without opposition, they?re going to have to force their radicalization of the ordinary moderate black citizen even harder. As they did in 1994, with the result that thousands of blacks were killed in KZN? history repeats itself. If Ramaphosa really wants his EWC, war seems inevitable.",sa-news,0
Why Has Ramaphosa or Cele Never Visited A White Victim of Crime? Because Under Their Watch There Are 24 Times More Murders Than in Apartheid?,"Despite Lockdown, June was a particularly bad month with almost 60 farm attacks and 7 farm murders, which probably means it was bad all round, once again highlighting that ANC?s Socialist South Africa is much worse than Iraq during war! Yet neither Ramaphosa or Bheki Cele have ever bothered to visit a white victim of crime, never mind even acknowledge that it happens. Why not? Do they feel it will expose the fact that there are 24 times more murders on their watch, than there were during apartheid, which they constantly resurrect and blame ? As these tweets reveal, even normal black people are longing for the safe peaceful days under apartheid, when they were looked after, everything worked, services were delivered reliably, and you could walk safely anywhere, anytime. A badly injured Dalene van der Hoven (80) was abducted from the farm Wanatha in Boesmanskop, Zastron, Free State in the early morning hours of Friday 3 July, 2020 and left on the mountainous Lesotho border in the bitter cold, ? 5° C, with only her pyjamas on and barefoot! The 4 black male attackers who had dumped her out in the cold, had assaulted her by hitting her over her head with a heavy iron tool. No doubt they had hoped the frail old lady would die and her death would be blamed on the elements. Dalene van der Hoven Lize du Plessis told Netwerk24 that her mother is currently in the high care neuro section of the Rosepark hospital in Bloemfontein where she is being treated for brain bleeding. Lize says her mother never wanted to carry a firearm and was good to the workers and had a good relationship with them. Lize says her mother was a soft hearted angel of a woman. This attack also proves that information about movements of farmers are given out to attackers , mostly by farm workers in the area. Lize says her brother, Wally, who stays on the farm with her mother, had told the workers they have to look well after elderly Mrs Van der Hoven, because he had to be go to Bloemfontein for a meeting on Thursday. It is suspected the attackers knew this. Mrs Van der Hoven only woke up when the attackers were in the room with her. They broke through the outer safety gate and another one near her room with a plow iron bar, so they came prepared. They immediately hit the elderly woman, who can?t possibly pose a threat to them, over the head with a heavy iron tool. She opened the small safe for the attackers and they took the money, a few thousand rand, which was in it. They found the keys for the big safe in the small safe and took 2 rifles and a shotgun. It belonged to Mrs Van der Hoven?s husband Naas who has already passed on. The attackers already knew that there was an Audi and Ford motor belonging to the family and they asked the keys. They took the Audi and they took Mrs Van der Hoven with them, maybe because they wanted her to drive in case they struggle. They made her sit in the back seat between 2 attackers. They drove up the mountain pass and left her on the Lesotho side, in the middle of the night and without her glasses or shoes. Cold, half blind and wounded, the brave old woman found a shack on the Lesotho side of the border and after struggling for a while, the people finally opened and they helped her and gave her blankets. They actually knew a farmer, Tommie Rautenbach, who is a neighbour of Mrs Van der Hoven, and they phoned him. He answered his phone and he mobilized farmers after which they went to fetch her. Lize then rushed her mother to hospital. Other notable recent incidents are: ? TORTURED WITH BOILING WATER Farm AttackSchalk Coetzee (63) told Netwerk24 that he gave the 3 farm attackers everything they wanted and never attempted to fight back during a farm attack which happened on 6 June 2020 on the farm Libertas in Reivilo, North West, yet they brutally beat and tortured him and his wife Lana (63) and left them for dead. Lana says that she was sitting behind the computer when she heard a noise and looked around. A tremendous blow landed on her head and she was continuously beaten and kicked. Her cheekbone, her nose and eye socket were all pulverized and had to be operated on afterwards. Her skull was also fractured and her eyeball kicked out of position. Her ear drum burst. Six of Schalk?s ribs were broken when he was hit with a rifle butt. His hands were so tightly bound with barbed wire that he had to undergo an operation to his hands afterwards to fix nerve damage. farm attackSchalk still has to go to hospital to drain liquid where his lungs are damaged. Schalk says that after he gave their bank cards and pins, the attackers still went to boil water which was thrown on his back. Some of it was thrown on Lana?s head. The attackers loaded everything they could into the couple?s vehicle and left. Lana ran a kilometer through the field to get help. Three suspects were caught in Schweizer Reineke but the authorities released 2 already. SIX HOUR LONG HOME INVASION FARM ATTACK IN LUSTHOF GAUTENG On 25 June, 2020 Sonja Mostert (52) and Schalk van Heerden (55) were attacked on a smallholding in Lusthof, Gauteng. The attack lasted 6 hours in which the attackers plundered the house and loaded furniture and other items in the couple?s vehicles before they left. There were 2 black male attackers, one armed with a pistol and one armed with a wrench. One attacker at one stage pulled down Sonja?s pyjama pants and unzipped his own pants. Sonja says she looked the attacker straight in his eyes and asked him if he knows God. She says her faith saved her as the attacker then left. The attacker also told her he already killed her partner which made her believe Schalk was dead. The attackers also took R18,000 which Schalk had withdrawn for salaries of workers. ? FRIENDS ATTACKED IN HOUSE ON SMALLHOLDING, ORDERED TO UNDRESS, ONE EXECUTED. Edwin Coetzee was visiting his friend Rudi Botha on Saturday evening 25 June, 2020 on his smallholding in Buffelsdrift, north of Pretoria when 3 masked black male attackers surprised them in the house after they broke in through a window. They ordered the friends to undress and made them lie down on the cement floor. When Edwin got up to plead that the men must not kill them, he was shot in the neck. The attackers were busy in the house for hours whilst Edwin slowly bled out. When the attackers left in one of the friend?s vehicles, Rudi managed to give a knife to Edwin and Edwin cut Rudi loose. It was the last thing he did. Edwin died on the scene. ? This past Tuesday, 30 June, 2020, a farm worker, Fernando Dete (21), was killed when farm workers were attacked in Dewagensdrift, outside Pretoria. These incidents are only some of the attacks that took place and there are many other attacks and farm murders, however has Bheki Cele or Cyril Ramaphosa ever once visited a white victim of crime? No they have not. We are nothing to them. We are the enemy in their eyes. Farm attacks happen daily and the attackers mostly use extreme violence which is not necessary if their aim was just stealing. They want to injure and torture and they must feel some form of bizarre justification for their cruelty, which they no doubt get from politicians from the ANC and EFF, who preach hatred against whites on a daily basis to deflect from their massive looting activities. But some blacks are waking up: ANC worse than apartheid Better under Apartheid ",sa-news,0
VIDEO: Farmer Evacuated as Land Thieves Occupy Farm Despite Court Order & Demolished Shacks! Police Seek Landgrab Scam Ringleaders!,"Update on the ongoing Elandsfontein landgrab fraud at De Deur, Vereeniging: The farm owner and his mother were evacuated from the farm for their own safety, because it was clear the misled invaders were going to keep coming back. Evacuation was the right decision under the circumstances because petrol bombs have already been thrown into a building. The video was taken by the owner before being evacuated. The owners were were guarded right throughout the night, but when the men guarding them gad barely gone, they had to come back because the land thieves had waited for them to leave, and were back. A witness who was one of the 16 farmers against the 1,500 invaders, said it was very tense and everyone who thinks farmers should just start shooting at invaders, should realize that any action that is not strictly self-defense, will push us deeper into the mess, because it will make us look like the aggressors. If the video does not load above, watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EwHkiaN88 Civil war is not a game he said, and when the shots start to fly, there will be no turning back. The invaders can mobilize 200 taxis in one night, don?t make the mistake of thinking they are not ready, they are hungry for violence and just looking for any excuse to start blaming our \""privileged asses\"" for it. They have been deliberately radicalized and militarized. The right opportunity will emerge and hopefully by that time each macho farmer will have joined groups and stopped undermining each other, and start to stand together, so that we as one people can cope with the hordes. The Midvaal Local Municipality says police are looking for the ring leaders of the Elandsfontein landgrab, after the army, along with other law enforcement agencies, demolished structures in compliance with a court order obtained by the Midvaal Local Municipality. Squatters invaded the privately-owned land earlier this month and erected shacks and it is alleged there is a syndicate in the area that is scamming poor and vulnerable people with some being tricked into paying R250 for a piece of land. Those arrested will be charged with contravention of the court order. \""As the municipality, we successfully managed to get a blanket court order that then covers all the properties that were not initially included in the other court orders that was applied for by the property owners. So, this morning, as expected, the invaders assembled or had their own meeting to also deal with? their way forward. The information we got on the ground is they are planning to go ahead with the invading over a couple of days,\"" says Midvaal MMC for Community Development, Mokete Motsamai.",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: How Black Men (& Women) Create Multiple Single Mothers Keeping Blacks in Poverty Rife with Drugs, Gender & Sexual Violence!","Cold Hard Truth: American chat shows are well known for trying to be controversial and this one inadvertently revealed a cold hard truth that very few liberals would discuss, never mind admit. This video shows how just 6 Black men have 87 kids from 50 different women! That is 137 people who are going to struggle with life being disadvantaged thanks to the irresponsible selfish self indulgent actions of these 6 men! Black men are by far the main reason why blacks are stuck in the poverty socio economic trap, rife with gender based violence, sexual assault, drugs and criminality. They are feral and out of control to put it bluntly, but this is not isolated to African Americans, as you will find it in the townships of southern Africa all the way up to deep rural Western Africa? it is cultural and historic? It is common in the townships and squatter camps of South Africa to find a black man who has half a dozen \""wives\"" (one for each day of the week), who feeds and breed him on the day he decides to visit. Often she is under the impression he is out there looking for work most of the week, when in reality he is being serviced by his other women. However lets be clear, no one is holding a gun to these women?s heads, forcing them to breed? social grants also have to carry a big share of the blame here. Indeed, socialists want to control everything and put a permit or licence on everything, so maybe they should introduce a licence to have kids? But once again, like gun laws, that would affect the law abiding people only and black men will just carry on regardless. Socialism does not work because it depends on masses of poor people to swindle out of their money and votes. This occurs a lot in the muslim community too because they can legally do it, and their religion encourages the use of it as a weapon of conquest! HOWEVER WHITES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE MULTIPLE WIVES BY LAW! If video does not load above, watch here: https://www.bitchute.com/video/5BDKf23gwsHU/ So, even the law is designed to commit white genocide because, the iceberg below the surface is that these black men are literally stealing resources away from other cultures and races! They are literally breeding white people out of existence because whites choose to have less kids, so that their kids can have a better quality of life. Blacks then come and demand resources from these very same white families that made the sacrifice of having less kids! Who thanks to mass media induced white guilt, end up giving in to the these aggressive demands! Furthermore, to add insult to injury, these black kids will use up a higher proportion of national, educational, social and welfare resources, pushing whites aside, especially when they come with their victimhood and black lives matter propaganda! This is clear genocide, whether it is deliberate, manipulated, endemic, cultural, or accidental, it is still genocide. ",sa-news,0
The ANCs Relentless Radical Transformation of Once Beautiful Bloemfontein into Mangat-in! A Bankrupt Sh*thole!,"Relentless tolerance of #TheAfricanWay has led to relentless decay and rot! The story of Africa under African rulers is always one of relentless decay, dilapidation and looting. At the time the old NP handed over the 1st world country to the ANC, cities and towns were clean and infrastructure, like railways and Eskom were some of the best functioning in the world. Bloemfontein was a gem, until the relentless tolerance of #TheAfricanWay started. The thing with slow relentless decay is, people won?t realize they tolerated their way out of solutions and options, until it is way too late. Take a look at what happened in Bloemfontein, because what is happening there, is happening all over the country. The relentless rot starts slow and then suddenly after years and years of neglect, the filth and brokenness will hit people like a bucket of water in the face. But by then it will be too late and it will be clear that there are just no answers anymore within the system. The black socialists and their kowtowing liberal media will invent narratives and #fauxrage like the coffin duo case or the George Floyd one, to hide all this, and trick moderates into tolerating even more, but they won?t be able to hide the cesspool they created forever. The dirtiness, stench and rot they created will be all too evident eventually and suddenly a 1st world gem is an african sh*thole. Like a bucket of water in the face. Bloemfontein residents are worried because it looks like the decay and almost non existent service delivery in their town is getting worse by the day. Just when you think you?ve seen the worst, the ANC does even worse. Everywhere in town there are traffic lights that are not working and potholes are everywhere. Prof. Fief van der Merwe, a DA councillor of the Mangaung ? or is that Mangat-in ? metro told Netwerk24 that there is almost not a single intersection that functions properly anymore due to broken traffic lights. This problem is appearing all over the country as cables are looted and not fixed because the money has been looted. Not to mention the commuter train overhead electric cable infrastructure that was almost completely carried away in the Cape Town region, which means that there is effectively no train commuter service in the Cape peninsula anymore. Prof. Van der Merwe also says that when roads, kerbs and railings are damaged by drunken motorists, the damage don?t get fixed. He says the private road construction company Raubex has fixed 47 potholes in Waverley road in Bloemfontein at their own cost. The paint on the road indicating road lanes, don?t get done over when the paint fades. All over town are rusted and hanging stop signs which were driven almost out of the ground and just left like that. The street name boards are either so rusted that nobody can read the street name or it was stolen. The new Cubana restaurant was built almost into the street, leaving almost no pavement, as building regulations are ignored. Bloemfontein There is also an open canal that stretches from the Prellerplein shopping centre to the Loch Logan waterfront that causes a terrible stench because of untreated sewage, that keeps on flowing into the canal. Residents of the neighbourhoods Dan Pienaar and Brandwag in Bloemfontein are affected by the stinking canal. Johan and Anneri Pretorius have told Netwerk24 that they get nauseous from the smell inside their home and also can?t use their braai place outside because the smell. Prof. Pretorius has been trying to get the municipality to fix the problem on behalf of the Pretorius family and other residents for years, and has written countless letters to the municipality management, and also went to speak personally with the management but nothing gets done. The problem is blockages in the sewage system which the municipality is unable to fix. The canal with the untreated sewage eventually flows into the Loch Logan waterfront which obviously causes massive problems there as well. In the meantime the Bloemfontein Metro municipality is hopelessly bankrupt and had to be put under administration by the Provincial government, which in itself is hopelessly corrupt and inept. There is just no solutions with an ANC government for which looting is the main objective and a black African population that supports this criminal organization called the ANC fanatically. This is Africa. The bigger the thief, the more he or she is venerated. Mugabe was called the Lion of Africa despite killing so many of his own and letting many others starve, as was Shaka Zulu? #TheAfricanWay",sa-news,0
"#BlackPrivilege ABSA Lets Black Manager Keep Both Jobs After Extreme Racism, Yet Whites Lose Jobs & Get Jail for Lesser Comments!","INTERNET DOES NOT FORGET: Nearly two years ago SA-News reported on Neo Mongwaketse, an Absa Manager who posted on Facebook that \""Your white sh*t arrogance lead to that torture and for white like you, I feel no pity\"". This post started trending again on google search this week, so we decided to do an update, especially since he still has his TWO jobs, despite an internal review! This is double standards at its best in South Africa. It seems that only a certain race has the privilege to freedom of speech, hate speech and racism, but if you are white you lose or job and even go to jail for making similar comments If ABSA or Neo Mongwaketse, who has been a Service Manager since 2014, AND a Manager at a Swift Centre of Excellence since August 2017, in Johannesburg (two jobs?), was hoping that his racist comment posted on the 26th of August 2018, justifying torture of whites with no pity, would just go away and disappear into the memory hole of the past, they have a surprise coming. The internet does not forget and the the memory hole that mainstream media, corporates and governments were so used to helping them bury their sins, and letting them disappear in the mists of time, no longer exists. In fact we regularly find old articles trending again, like the 2 year old video about Land Expropriation without compensation being called a Declaration of War, by the Leader of the HNP, Mr Andries Breytenbach, which suddenly received 110,000 views a few months ago! See the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW273gSW0A0 When SA-News saw that the article we posted about Neo Mongwaketse almost two years ago, had started trending on google search again this week, it prompted us to revisit the story. We were disappointed, but not surprised, to find that ABSA had allowed Neo to keep his two jobs with just a slap on the wrist! Having previously been an IT Ops Manager for ABSA with an IT background, Neo should have known the consequences of his actions, so he could not plead ignorance? One wonders what would have happened had a white person gone to their local police station and lodged a formal complaint? Probably be chased away. In fact, had it not been for a complaint made on ABSA?s own website, on 21st October 2018 by a Lorraine V, Neo would probably not even have been investigated or reprimanded! Her complaint reads: ABSA RACIST MANAGER Please investigate the absolutely racist statements by Neo Mongwaketse, I find it offensive and can not see that a member of ABSA stating that ? your white **** arrogance lead to that torture and for white like you, I feel no pity. I am a long time customer of of ABSA and if the matter is not addressed I will be taking my business elsewhere. It is all over faceboo****! Only 3 days later, on the 24th October, a Daphne Le Grange from ABSA responded to the complaint that it had been investigated internally, posting the following response: Dear Lorraine \""The incident of an employee making racist remarks on social media on 26 August 2018 was viewed in serious light. We undertook an initial internal investigation into the matter, following which the employee was placed on immediate suspension pending a completion of the investigation and a possible disciplinary process. In order to ensure an independent and unbiased outcome, we appointed external counsel, an Advocate from the Johannesburg Bar, to chair the disciplinary hearing. The hearing was held on the 25 September 2018. The employee accepted that his comments were inappropriate and amounted to a breach of Absa?s values. He demonstrated genuine remorse for the harm caused by his conduct and unreservedly apologised. After careful consideration of all submissions, the Chairperson concluded that the most appropriate sanction would be a final written warning and mandatory diversity and related training. The training is to assist him to embrace the values of non-racialism and diversity advocated by Absa and understand how to better manage his reaction to inflammatory situations. Having decided on an independent chairperson, Absa accepts the ruling.\"" Regards Daphne Le Grange It is anybody?s guess as to whether the \""diversity training\"" indoctrination actually took place or what it contained (a course in Marxism?). Clearly there is great dissatisfaction at the outcome of this inquiry, even after nearly two years, which is probably why it started trending again on Google search. The HelloPeter complaint system ABSA uses is linked to Facebook, where readers expressed their disgust at the outcome of the internal inquiry: Yvona posted: Neeeee! As dit n wit persoon was wat dit gese het,was hy summier afgedank!!!! Onaanvaarbaar!! Sal my besigheid ook nader bank skuif soos vele ander vriende!! L Dalene said: Ekskuus????? A written warning after such racist remarks. I am sorry this is totally unaccepted?.and unfair as usual?.ABSA this is going to cost you!!!!! Afriforum will take this further. Pieter added: this is not the only case you should investigate more in to this as you are going to lose a lot of customers including me It appears Afriforum did not take it further and essentially nothing was done about it, and Neo kept his jobs because he had \""remorse\"", and obviously had a black skin. However, he had no pity for the whites being tortured? \""Remorse\"" is not enough though for when white?s transgress. They lose their jobs, houses and everything and are even locked up in jail and demonised for life! Blacks can threaten whites and call them names, inciting violence and hatred whenever they like on social media with no consequences. No wonder whites say that double standards are the norm in South Africa. At the very least Neo?s comment should rank above Penny Sparrow?s \""monkeys in the sea\"" comments (she also had genuine remorse), as regards hate speech, as Neo Mongwaketse?s racist comment contains an actual reference to violence and torture, saying it is deserved, so it should not be unsurprising if Neo Mongwaketse became infamous too?",sa-news,0
VIDEO: #WhitePrivilege Does not Exist but #BlackPrivilege Does! #BLM & BBBEE Affirmative Action is Doing More Harm Than Good to Blacks!,"LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD: Does Chinese Privilege exist in China? Does Indian Privilege exist in India? Does Nigerian Privilege Exist in Nigeria? Black Privilege does however exist in Western countries as well as black countries! Affirmative action has become an imperialist means of conquest and supremacy aimed at turning all countries into black countries. How long does affirmative action go on for? At what stage will \""compensation\"", \""retribution\"" or \""revenge\"" have been achieved? How much must be given? Entire countries? With systemic, institutional and structural black privilege already deeply built into every aspect of daily life, all we have achieved was to make anti-white racism systemic, institutional and structural in our societies! It is time blacks grew up, stepped up to the plate and threw off the crutch of black privilege, so that they can achieve on their own merit and not by pushing whites down or claiming victimhood. They should stop leveraging their victimhood for financial, social and emotive gain! Singapore stopped affirmative action because they saw it was more destructive than good. Can any black person truly say they have achieved what they did on their own? That they were not artificially pushed ahead of others? Not only is it doing more damage to the black psyche, creating a feeling of insecurity and inferiority, leading to an attitude of entitlement which leads to the disgraceful public violence we have witnessed, it also creates an opportunity for subversive world supremacist far left wing forces to hijack their black agenda, like antifa, communists and Muslim Brotherhood / CAIR. It also encouraged hate filled whites to offload their alleged white guilt onto other whites, creating incredible division, familial strife and social unrest. If racism is about control, then whites in South Africa cannot be racist because they are not in control. Blacks have been in complete control since 1994 and for blacks to still pretend it is the white man?s fault is simply disingenuous, and just an excuse to deflect from their massive failure and inability to govern, brought about by dependency on hand outs, hand ups and foreign aid ? the same kind of dependency affirmative action creates. If the video does not load above, please watch here: https://youtu.be/r9-27Ee8osw How can it be right to have race based affirmative action regulations if racism is wrong, yet South Africa has 114 race based laws and regulations? Two wrongs do not make a right! Blacks have now been trained, yes trained by their so called leaders, to prefer victimhood (#BlackPrivilege) over equality ? affirmative action BBBEE is justified and perpetuated by this perpetual victimhood, which requires constant anti-white hate speech and prevents true black emancipation (like apartheid envisaged!) In fact it has gone even further by legislating racist regulations which is supposed to be wrong? This blatant disconnect creates even more trouble and destroys any message the world supremacist governing bodies or so called moral leaders try assert. It is simply immoral and unconstitutional. The overwhelming legacy of Zimbabwe will always be that the enforced black privilege created a humanitarian disaster. One day South African blacks will no longer have someone to swear at, using the modern day equivalent of \""k*ffer\"", namely \""racist\"", and will be too busy scrapping to make ends meet, whilst the country is thrashed to its knees because of corruption and the demise of the Rand. No taxis will be big enough to carry the suitcases of money to buy a loaf of bread. So if it empowers them to insult whites, this relief will only be short term, but the effects will have devastating long term consequences, for generations to come? and will perpetuate their inferiority complex. More harm than good.",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: \""Farm Murderers Paid by ANC & EFF To Kill\"" Says Zimbabwean Truck Driver in SA, on His Way To Canada!","A sound recording received by SA-News, which cannot be verified, but sounds authentic given the background noise, portrays an interview with a Zimbabwean truck driver in South Africa, who has somehow managed to arrange to go to Canada in November. He claims that farm murderers are locals and foreigners, that are paid by both the ANC and EFF, using taxpayers money! He says ANC and Ramaphosa are trying to play a smart game. He claims blacks do not care about food security but get paid a lot of money to do the murders. He also says South African blacks are not learning the lesson from Zimbabwe?s mistakes.

#Blackwash Roll Call of #FarmMurders & #FarmAttacks Totally Ignored as Liberal Worlds Virtue Signaling Reaches Existential Proportions!,"DO WHITE LIVES MATTER? Farm attacks and murders have raged on in South Africa and as usual have been ignored by the Liberal Establishment. Farm attacks and murders are not new at all in South Africa and have been allowed to flourish for 3 decades, by the ANC government and other black supremacist parties who wage a slow racial war of attrition against the South African white minority. Even though the ANC government does not keep these statistics, the facts and figures on this are clear because the statistics are being kept by Afrikaner organizations like Afriforum, ToekomsVonk and TLU SA. The ANC and their left wing accomplices, like the liberal media and certain immoral militant antifa linked social media groups, try their best to cover it up, to perpetuate their anarchist agenda. These are the reported incidents that we are aware of for the period of 1 June 2020 to 27 June 2020. The fact that almost all the victims were white and the perpetrators almost exclusively black, indicates that white are specifically targeted group with these attacks.

BBBEE Nappy The 17 Race Based Legislation during the Apartheid Years (some of these are still used by the ANC regime): Internal Security Act, 1982 Public Safety Act, 1953 Riotous Assemblies Act, 1930 Suppression of Communism Act, 1950 General Laws Amendment Act, 1962 Unlawful Organisations Act, 1960 Defence Act, 1967 Publications Act, 1963 Armaments Development and Production Act, 1968 Newspaper and Imprint Registration Act, 1971 Petroleum Products and the Nuclear Energy Act, 1977 Police Act, 1979 National Key Points Act, 1982 Protection of Information Act, 1982 Population Registration Act, 1950 Groups Area Act, 1957 Media Regulations Act, 1986 Malema apartheid Needles to say the ANC is still working on increasing its oppression of the white minority and is adding more and more race based laws. One of these is the Expropriation without Compensation Bill for which a constitutional amendment has already been approved by Parliament. In response to this, a group called \""BLACK MONDAY SA\"" sent a firm warning to the ANC on \""International Land Expropriation Laws\"" in an Open Letter to the ANC Government of South Africa in Parliament, President Cyril Ramaphosa (in particular) and Deputy President David Mabuza in 2019: \""Please take note that you are hereby warned by the BLACK MONDAY MOVEMENT SA, that you are moving on dangerous ground in regards to your planned Expropriation of White-Owned Property Without Compensation in South Africa. You are walking on borrowed time? Let it be known, take cognisance, and be warned that you will be committing War Crimes as noted by: *IMT Charter (Nuremberg)* Article 6(b) of the 1945 IMT Charter (Nuremberg) includes \""plunder of public or private property\"" in its list of war crimes, for which there must be individual responsibility. *Geneva Convention IV* Article 33, second paragraph, of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV provides that \""pillage is prohibited\"". *Additional Protocol II* Article 4(2)(g) of the 1977 Additional Protocol II prohibits acts of pillage against \""all persons who do not take a direct part or who have ceased to take part in hostilities\"". *ICC Statute* Pursuant to Article 8(2)(b)(xvi) and (e)(v) of the 1998 ICC Statute, \""[p]illaging a town or place, even when taken by assault\"" is a war crime in both international and non-international armed conflicts. *Nuremberg Principles* Principle VI(b) of the 1950 Nuremberg Principles adopted by the International Law Commission provides that \""plunder of public or private property\"" is a war crime. *UN Command Rules and Regulations* Under Rule 4 of the 1950 UN Command Rules and Regulations, Military Commissions of the UN Command had jurisdiction over offences such as plunder of public and private property. *ICTY Statute* Article 3(e) of the 1993 ICTY Statute gives the Tribunal jurisdiction over violations of the laws and customs of war, expressly including \""plunder of public and private property\"" However, being a non aligned state, the ANC tends to side with its communist partners like China, Cuba and Venezuela and ignores all of these international standards and treaties.

"As Covid19 Starts Peaking in SA, ANC Cabinet Infighting Causes Delays, Confusion & Court Cases, Exposing ANCs Inability to Govern!","As South Africa enters the top 20 in countries affected by the CCPvirus, panic seems to have spread in the Ramaphosa cabinet where serious differences have developed among members of the Cabinet, with regards to the handling of the pandemic response. This is further compounded by their lack of experience, knowledge and respect for procedural and constitutional regulations, resulting in 116 cases where the ANC government has been taken or threatened with court! The Covid-19 pandemic does not accept lies and sweeping mistakes under the \""racism\"" carpet, which ANC normally gets away with. Mkhize, the Minister of Health, who has been schmoozing through the last few months of relatively low Covid19 infection numbers, especially given that all other health dept. functions and treatments have been largely swept aside, has realised the last few month were meant for actual preparing, not just dishing out tender cash and talking the talk. Mkhize has warned that the relaxation of lockdown measures is to allow the economy to get back on track, but could lead to a social collapse, because the relaxation will have a direct impact on the country?s health system. No doubt his biggest fear is that the coming weeks will expose just how weak the country?s healthcare system is and how unprepared it is to deal with a full scale pandemic, despite months of warning. The relief measures announced in Phase 3 and subsequent adjustments involving salons, was largely done in response to pressure from business and the public sector, who demanded improvement in the overall economic situation, and to meet the demands of the institutions. This has opened vast differences between Mboweni and Mkhize on the next steps to be taken, just as the tobacco debacle was a clear disagreement between Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ) and Ramaphosa. The ANC government of Cyril Ramaphosa has now been threatened with 116 court cases, for his decisions on the application of Covid19 response measures and their impact on the population. Ramaphosa?s response measures have often been unpopular and challenged in court, like the prohibition of cigarette sales, which is one of the most prominent cases that put the ANC government in a bad light. This has made Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ), the most controversial figure in the cabinet, even despite Bheki Cele?s police brutality. NDZ has been accused of being behind the measure that cigarettes may not be sold, because of her association with cigarette smugglers and her son?s directorship in a Tobacco company, from whom she is believed to benefit financially. If you can make 2.2 Billion disappear from the National Cleaning budget, anything is possible! As the Minister of the Department of Cooperative Governance, NDZ has released information on how the government is being legally challenged by individuals and institutions in court for their actions. She said several cases have been settled out of court, showing that the government is extremely sensitive to losing and is to blame for poor decision-making, while others are being finalized in court. Various cases deal with the constitutional rights of people which are infringed by ANC government measures, but there are also cases of a more personal nature where people?s rights are harmed. The Minister of Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu, has come under fire again, and this time on the release of regulations on control of food distribution to people in need, after she introduced a controversial method of doing distributing food aid, which was rejected by the SA Human Rights Commission shortly thereafter. The Minister then did not dare to make any announcement for a few weeks, as she was repeatedly criticized for the way she manages her department, as the new measures announced by her are by no means good enough to meet the needs of the poor, and are in some cases even unimplementable. Her Dept. regulation stipulates, inter alia, that soup kitchens may not allow people to sit and eat them, and the needy also need to bring their own containers in which the soup will be created, but the national regulations stipulate that soup kitchens and restaurants should maintain social distance and that hygiene must be applied. Opposition parties have also threatened to drag the embattled minister Zulu to court if she does not comply with the laid down rules that apply.",sa-news,0
"How \""Anti-Racism\"" Handicaps Blacks. Blacks & Liberal Whites Should Stop Treating Blacks like Disabled People!","Running Faster: A noteworthy piece posted on social media, claims to be from ex Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, although this is improbable, given she holds a chair in Social Justice at Stellenbosch University and would get fired if she dared spoke truth like this. However the source is irrelevant. It insightfully calls on blacks to stop using racism as a crutch and an excuse. Like SA-News has been saying, blacks need to take off their BBBEE nappy and grow up and raise their game. Otherwise they will never be equal because they will never see themselves as equal, instead of always seeing themselves as the victim, and constantly crying, or trying to profit from hurtful words. Liberal whites who constantly proclaim blacks are victims, are in effect saying they are superior to blacks and that blacks can?t survive without their virtue signaling! Black people use racism as an excuse for their failures in a lot of things. Racism makes us feel like victims and remember that victims never rise. The reason we don?t succeed after every war is because of our inability to move forward? We don?t forgive and we keep focusing on the enemy instead of picking up the pieces and building afresh. I think the reason the Afrikaner & Boer nations were able to build themselves into a formidable nation (after the Boer War) was to forget the past and found ways to empower themselves. The Boers were * oppressed, * confined to concentration camps by the English. The Indians where brought here because the black man was too lazy to work in the sugar cane fields. (Even Nigerians say this). They lived in desperate, poor conditions, no lights, no running water, no proper housing. Yet both nations rose and sent their kids to school. * they were murdered in thousands, * their women were raped and * their babies starved to death in camps. * But they rose, because they moved beyond the hatred of their enemies. Instead of toyi-toying, they: * built their own schools, * taught and trained their kids to: * work hard and farm the land. * they taught their kids real values of respect. The problem with us Black People, is that we see ourselves as victims. We feel sorry for ourselves and, therefore, feel that we deserve? * Free things. * Free houses, * Free money. We don?t teach our kids the value of hard work. Our greatest enemy as a black race today is blaming everybody and hating ourselves. We hate ourselves so much that: * we destroy the things that belong to us. * we destroy our schools, * we destroy libraries * we destroy hospitals that were all given to us by white money! Check this out: 1. Of all the Black women raped yesterday, most of them were raped by Black men. 2. Of all the Black people that were robbed yesterday, most of them were robbed by Black men. 3. Of all the Black owned houses that were broken into yesterday, most done by Black men. 4. Of all young Black men that were shot and killed or stabbed to death yesterday, most were killed by our Black men. 5. Of all the Black owned cars that were hijacked yesterday, most were carried out by Black men. 6. Of all the ATM cards that were swapped, mostly by Black men. 7. Of all the cars that were involved in smash and grabs yesterday, most involved Black men. This is self hate and it is destroying us, Black people. Let?s face our real demons (US) as a Black race and rise to the occasion. We have destroyed the culture of learning within our communities and replaced it with entertainment. RACISM IS NOT OUR DOWNFALL. BUT FAILURE TO FIND OURSELVES AND MOVE ON, MOST CERTAINLY IS! We have had over 26 years of freedom, WHAT HAVE WE DONE FOR OURSELVES? * LET?S LEARN FROM OTHER NATIONS, * LET?S LEARN FROM THE BOERS, AFRIKANERS AND THE INDIANS AND GOD WILL HEAL US.",sa-news,0
"Soweto is 1,000 Times More Racist Than Orania! Yet Lesufi, The Afrikaans Hating Black Supremacist Threatens Oranias Constitutional Right To Exist!","While schools burn down in Gauteng, it?s black supremacist MEC, Panyaza Andrek Lesufi is moonlighting by racebaiting and attacking citizens of another province! Seems Lesufi wants to round up all Afrikaners & send them to assimilation camps, if his rant at a wreath laying ceremony, for a long dead terrorist, is anything to go by (how much did that cost us taxpayers?) The anti afrikaans racist has threatened to close Orania for a while now, yet Andrek Lesufi?s own home town of Tembisa is 98.9% pure bantu, but he has the audacity to attack Orania which is only 97.2% white! Will he close Tembisa and Soweto too, which sports a stunning 98.7% bantu racepurity ? more than Orania? Lazy ANC cadres who live in a privileged BBBEE bubble, love pulling fake racecards, to repeat their racist lies about white in order to polarise and garner black voters, to sustain their lazy black privileged lifestyle, but the real facts of the matter are completely ignored! They are so lazy they cannot even look up real stats, because racebaiting is so easy and so effective, thanks to the complicit lapdog mainstream media in South Africa. The perennial target for these lazy anti white racists is poor little old Orania, a tiny cultural settlement for Afrikaans to preserve their culture from assimilation by black supremacists like Andrek Lesufi. The place is more of a museum than anything else, yet these big black babies in BBBEE nappies cry about it incessantly, as if it will steal their BBBEE bottle of milk! The truth, according to the census, is that literally THOUSANDS of Blacks ONLY (pure bantu) \""Orania?s\"", much much larger than Orania, and more racially pure than Orania, were uncovered by SA-News a few years ago. In order to remind Andrek Lesufi we decided it was time to republish our findings. These stats make the majority of people in South Africa, especially the lazy mainstream media and politicians who constantly attack Orania, hypocritical anti-white racists. Apart from article 235, the SA Constitution also names Freedom of Association as a constitutional right. Nazi lesufi racistWhy has ANC not renamed the bantu enclave called Soweto yet? Like many normal people we have had enough of the constant whining, crying and victimhood from liberal and black politicians and elitist circles about Orania, the Afrikaner heritage town, and after the latest attack by Lesufi on Orania, just to garner news sensation for themselves, (as so many before them) we decided to test their \""moral high ground\"" again. SA News did some research and discovered hundreds of large Blacks Only towns, which proves that the majority of people in South Africa, who attack Orania, are hypocritical anti-white racists, willingly inciting black supremacy and domination, attacking whites without looking at their own racism. And boy, were we shocked by the extent of black supremacy and self-determination that has been achieved by the black bantu and black supremacist ANC in South Africa. It would make even Apartheid jealous! In less than an hour we found about a dozen towns and even entire municipalities with more racial purity than even Orania! But with black bantu as the dominant and sometimes even total demographic. We used the figures from the 2011 census. 4.6 Million (10%) of SA Bantu live in 7,000 100% pure Bantu villages, NO Colored, Indians or Whites! 75% of all bantu live in towns more race pure than Orania! With the trend being a very sharp growth in black population against a white population that is plummeting, these figures certainly are conservative and no doubt, now a decade later they are probably much worse! SA Land issue I can only shake my head in disbelief and ask where the hell is the press in South Africa? Too busy roleplaying at being token journalists with big BBBEE salaries? Schmoozing around from meeting to meeting and hotel to hotel to dinners, in their BBBEE nappies, etc. using predictably safe headlines and articles about politically correct themes, in fast dying newspapers? We can expect something like this from globalist traitor press like Naspers and Argus/Cape Times/Star, the ANC government?s mouthpieces, but these figures have been lying around for s decade for all to see? We can now directly call Lesufi, Malema, Danny Jonas of the EFF and the BLF racist hypocrites, out and out racists and genocidal killers of nations. The obedient majority in South Africa can now, with evidence, be identified as hypocrites, even all those wannabe journo?s who so desperately take on Orania to make a name for themselves. Why did they not find or mention this? Too lazy. Too scared of the truth. The entire Albert Luthuli Municipality area is a mirror image of Orania as far as demographics are concerned, only reversed, BUT, we are talking about 186,000 bantu people as opposed to Orania?s mere 1,000 whites ? that is 186 TIMES GREATER! Their population is 97.6% pure bantu, and the small town of Orania is less pure at only 97.2% white. Hypocrites much? Albert Luthuli The entire Mkhondo Local Municipality is only 2% off from those excellent racepure bantu totals. In fact the entire Mpumalanga Province is also just a few percentage points off the mark for a pure black bantu Municipality! Thembisile Hani Local Municipality performs even better than that, with a population of 310,500 of which 99.2% are black bantu! They are almost pure, just a little more radical \""transformation\"" and racemixing comrades? Pixley ka Seme Local Municipality, named after the founder of the ignoble ANC, Pixley ka Isaka Seme (Whose ever heard of him?), is only 6% off Orania?s figure. Ironically the District in which Orania is located has the same name. Diepdale, does even better, with a population SIX TIMES GREATER than Orania, is 99.5% black bantu and not a single white resident. However a much more noteworthy performance than above, are racially pure towns like Manaar and Hartebeeskop that are up to twice the size of Orania, and are 100% pure black! Not a single Indian, not a single coloured and not a single white resident! Not even Orania can boast such perfect race purity. Well done! Truly black \""Nazi\"" towns as people pointing to Orania would say, but fail to see or mention the reverse. Black Orania Predictably there will be the defense spat out that whites are supposedly welcome to live in black towns and townships, but are they really? Just as there are allegations that Orania does not welcome blacks, the same can be said about these black Orania?s. Firstly, any new white resident in a black town will soon be targeted for all types of racist attacks and robberies and will have to live in a castle of steel. There have been many blacks recorded saying that whites are legitimate targets because of the distant past? one well known black actress even said (while she was blackmailing a white person) that she thought whites received money every minute by default! So any white person wanting to live in a township would have to abandon their culture and way of life and basically become bantu. No, the truth is whites are NOT welcome in townships ? we all know that.Genocidal much? Secondly, Europeans have a totally different culture of individuality and the principle of reward for honesty, hard work and merit. Certainly the African concept of bribery and corruption is considered illegal by most Europeans, so there would a substantial clash of cultures on a daily basis. Whites do not burn down their schools or university demanding free education. Thirdly, whites are definitely not welcome to live in the town and townships where large mines etc. are the major employers, with racist Black Economic Empowerment and affirmative action laws. Whites are forced to live where they can manage to find work despite the racist anti white BBBEE laws. Not sure if it their culture or just the culture of entitlement, but many africans have a way of forcing themselves on others, as if they think they have a right to be anywhere and everywhere, anytime, simply because they have black privilege, and they can pull the race card if you dare oppose them. I once had a black employee try force his way into our family Christmas dinner! He thought because everything was open in the rainbow nation, he could just invite himself in, yet I hadn?t even invited any of my close white friends, because it was a FAMILY dinner, so we had to endure being called racists because we wanted a FAMILY dinner! As it is, many white kids cannot go play in public areas because blacks force themselves into your personal space. I can only imagine what would happen to a white family who tried to settle in a black township, but wanted to retain their culture and language and heritage and way of life? many white people like being white, and if blacks have a problem with that, THEY are the racists.black power Furthermore, Europeans also prefer due process of the law, order and justice, and not lynchings where mobs take the law into their own hands, as we often see in black neighborhoods where people are just killed, with a \""winnie mandela necklace\"" without trial. We are not even talking of ancestor worship, witch doctors and muti killings or the misogyny and violent gender abuse? and you will not find guys from a white squatter camp murdering and raping an 85 year old black women for her cellphone! The Europeans are certainly unable to follow the township lifestyle where, if a neighbor gets a new TV, but no one else has one, it is taken or broken. Equality you know. Some black men have multiple women/wives for example, each in separate houses and towns, and spend one day a week at each woman?s house, where he is fed and bred. The other six women are under the impression he is out looking to find a job? This is insane ? Europeans may not even legally marry more than one wife, so even the law prevents whites from integrating into black culture and village life. There is absolutely no attempt by the government or black people to accommodate white people or to welcome them or to keep them safe even, to the contrary, the ANC government promotes anti white violence with its constant racist rhetoric! Who would want to go live amongst ANC and EFF voters who are told day in and day out that whites are bad and deserve to be robbed and killed? No, whites are NOT welcome in black towns! The choice is simply: let us assimilate whites, whites must throw away their own language, heritage and history and become black, or you will be called racist and your way of life and culture is not welcomed. That is the destruction of diversity in action. The persistent attacks on Afrikaans and \""White Money Capital\"" and our history is more than enough proof that Afrikaans and the European culture is seen as the enemy. But when it comes to gadgets, internet, BMWs, bling, long hair and western luxuries, blacks very quickly assimilate themselves into European culture, even using skin whitening creams, hair lighteners and spending thousands on hair extensions and clothes as well as European brand names. Yet they pretend to hate white culture and colonialism? The onrushing stream is clearly in one direction only and it has, and will, flood everything unless Europeans start to build dams to stem the flow or try redirect the flow a little bit at a time. They are literally being bred out of existence and out their own country because they CHOOSE to have less kids, so that their kids can have a higher quality of life. Africans however breed non-stop, without any concern for the welfare or standard of life for the child, then they demand the whites must give them everything because the hundreds of black kids are poor, because they breed so much? This is literally replacing whites kids with black ones. So what the hell are whites making sacrifices for? Whites are being asked to sacrifice multiple times, while blacks just take and demand and take. Yes, that is how different we are. White minority Let whites follow the bantu example and build our own towns like they do, where true diversity, language, history, culture and tradition is defended, because true diversity ensures the continued existence of humanity itself. We should follow the example bantu sets and demand and claim our cultural and historical right to exist in our own space. If someone points a finger to Orania, just name Albert Luthuli Local Municipality, Manaar, Hartebeeskop, Diepdale, Lochiel, Dundonald, Lebohang, Thembisile Hani Local Municipality, Soweto, Tembisa, etc. etc. Keeping in mind that the majority of ANC municipalities are bankrupt or under administration. The census database has now been put into Wikipedia and it is easy for anyone to see how racepure the bantu towns are. For instance the aforementioned hometown of Andrek Lesufi, Tembisa ? 98.9% bantu: Race pure tembisa Sadly we do not have the manpower or deep pockets like other so-called civil rights movements like Afri-Sol and politicians, so please look at your local demographic and please send details of any which are more than 97% black, to us at news @ sa-news.com This is not to say that we are appalled by the figures. On the contrary, we are very happy about this evidence that even with all the tremendous globalist, political and commercial pressure, for forced integration and \""transformation\"" aka racemixing, as well as billions spent on multiculturalism, and the promotion thereof on TV, and in the mass media, the natural pattern of like attracts like prevails, and strongly shines through even by supporters of these false ideologies. Nature will always win. The million dollar question is, how much of the land in those pure black enclaves are owned by residents, and how much is in the name of the King or the ANC regime and communist elites? Come on ANC/EFF put your money where your mouth is and go take the land in these Black enclaves. All the land that was in the bantu homelands was taken by the ANC regime? \""Birds of a feather flock together and poop on world supremacist communists\"". © Don V ",sa-news,0
How The ANC Weaponised Covid19 Pandemic to Push Black Supremacy & Implement Totalitarian Control. Pity ICC is Toothless!,"SA-News takes a blow-by-blow look at how the ANC regime capitalised on and weaponised the Covid-19 pandemic to profit, fight a racial jihad, and obtain totalitarian control, which was used to implement some questionable activities and transactions. If only the International Criminal Court was not so toothless, the ANC should be reported, but then the ANC already knows ICC is on their side! ? Once the ever opportunistic ANC realised the power a pandemic crisis afforded them, they conspired to take advantage of this international health crisis called COVID-19, which originated in far away China, controlled by the ANC\""s mentor, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), to speed up it?s slow racial war against the white community of South Africa and grab more state powers. ? In the words of Cyril Ramaphosa and his commander in the dictatorial politburo, or so called National Command Council, Nkosazana \"" Dr Twak\"" Dlamini Zuma (NDZ), and the ANC cabinet saw the CCP-virus as \""opportunity to restructure\"" the economy, in their words, so that black people can handed a bigger share of the economy, whether they worked for it or not. ? The ANC discriminated on the basis of race in emergency aid programs and food parcel programs. South Africa had the longest and strictest lockdown in the world, with the longest and most ridiculous list of accompanying regulations. This hard lockdown forced the closure of all businesses for a long period and then the ANC discriminated on the basis of race, excluding small and medium sized businesses owned by white people from official assistance programs, leaving many white families without an income. This hard lockdown was approached like a war, with the Army and Police fully mobilised in a brutal crackdown. ? Liberal mainstream media consented and approved of vile ANC conduct and racial warfare. It even called it fake news when news filtered out that the government would discriminate on the basis of skin colour in official assistance programs, even though the ANC government later defended their racially discriminatory stance in the High Court and Constitutional Court, in applications brought by the Solidarity Movement. ? There were many State crimes committed in the ANC?s brutal response.The Police arrested almost a quarter of a million people over trivialities like arresting 2 parents when their toddler ran onto the beach, and arresting a couple over selling hot take-away coffee. The Police also sent a patrol vehicle to stop the Cradle of Hope care centre in Krugersdorp, from distributing sandwiches for instance and the ANC actively sought to stop NGO?s from distributing food, making them apply for a permit each and every day, in a clear attempt to make it difficult for needy white families to obtain food. ? Rule by dictat and regulation became the norm, issued in terms of the Disaster Management Act, but many measures contained therein were completely ridiculous and came down to an effective suspension of the Constitution, like a ban on the sale of cigarettes and prohibiting people from exercising outside of a time window, of 06:00-09:00 at one stage, with a criminal sanction attached, meaning the Police arrested people over it. ? The lockdown became more and more of a farce as time dragged on with more and more ridiculous regulations issued, for instance when clothing shops were allowed to open but they could only sell government approved items like for instance, only shoes if they had closed toes. ? The government did not start to open the economy because they wanted to implement unconstitutional and ridiculous measures to keep people locked up. They were being challenged in court by a wide array of civil society organizations and the DA and VF+ political parties. ? The intention of the ANC was to close the economy for as long as possible to achieve political objectives, like breaking the white middle class by forcibly taking away their income and then exclude them from official assistance packages. ? The ANC succeeded in creating a pandemic of fear and pulled the wool over the eyes of many, even the people it racially targeted, into believing that a massive amount of people would die from the CCP-virus if the dictats of the State were not adhered to. Many people should be feeling deeply ashamed today after snitching and calling cruel jackboot cops on their neighbours, who for instance received a food package late at night, because Police did not allow the distribution of food to white people, or called the cops to step on neighbours who just ventured onto a beach without there being a danger to anyone. ? The government showed its true cruel, totalitarian and heartless self by locking people up for a full 85 days in various stages of severity, before people could return fully to work. The personal care industry like hairdressers being the last group allowed to return to work and resume their businesses, which are their only source of income, without having any regard of how people are supposed to live and pay their bills. Many hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs, or had to close businesses as a result of the hard lockdown. ? The ANC moved goalposts continuously and this was not questioned by liberal media. The initial explanation was for a 3 week lockdown to get hospitals ready. It then got dragged out and dragged out as the ANC?s other political objectives became clear. ? A lockdown cannot stop a virus from spreading. The total number of people who will die over the course of the pandemic, which can be up to 2 years, will not be changed by a lockdown. A lockdown can only slow the rate of people dying initially. ? A hard and drawn out lockdown imposed on a ravaged economy like that of South Africa, will cause more people to die from poverty and despair than will die from the CCP-virus. This was clearly stated by a panel of experts called PANDA, whose chairman also addressed an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa, because he and his government were only listening to their own kowtowing selected officials. ? The lockdown proved to be a lie, ensconced in a fallacy and wrapped in a falsehood. As lockdown reached day 85, nothing has changed in terms of the virus itself, with the number of dead and infected people steadily rising , yet people will now be allowed to go to the movies again and cut their hair again at hair salons. This was always possible to be done safely if the right protocols are followed. So what changed suddenly? Why were people locked up for so long? The ANC only allowed economic activity to resume after being taken to court by various sections of society, which challenged amongst other things, the Constitutionality of the lockdown itself. The ANC was being exposed and that is why it agreed to allow people to work again. If it was up to the ANC they would have still locked us up and forced us to sit at home without income. Well many of us at least. ? If there was any justice, the ANC should be charged in an international court for this brutal and lunatic crackdown in which it targeted especially the white minority, with brutal and fascist to the core State muscle, but it also affected some black people, with even a dozen black men being killed during the lockdown in Police brutality incidents. ? The ANC also profited hugely by turning the pandemic into a cash business by issuing emergency tenders to cronies utilising the normal kickback system or tsho-tsho #TheAfricanWay style. Some tenderpreneurs made so much money from corrupt Covid-19 PPE tenders, that one even bragged on social media about the 5 extremely luxurious cars he bought at one go. ? The ANC was so eager to hide its own racial war against whites in South Africa that it also jumped in the extreme left?s Black Lives Matter campaign, after the accidental death of George Floyd in America, and the ensuing #fauxrage initiated by globalists, even though ANC controlled troops beat a man, Collins Khoza, to death in his own residential yard. He was not the only one to be killed by ANC controlled security forces, about a dozen black men were killed in such Police brutality incidents. ? Churches also joined liberal mainstream media in condoning fascist and black supremacist behavior by the ANC State, by not speaking up about the ANC?s racist and brutal behavior, showing that they are able to be easily bought by the ANC. ? Black controlled political parties without exception all condoned and accepted the ANC?s actions as if they were suddenly giddy at the chance of teaching the white minority a lesson. The EFF consistently and vehemently opposed any easing of lockdown regulations to ensure more white people are getting unemployed and losing their businesses due to bankruptcy. Mmusi Maimane, ex DA leader, even went to court asking for the lockdown level to be moved back to level 4 from level 3. ? The only groups that can walk away from this crisis with head held high are the Solidarity Movement, Afriforum, the Democratic Alliance political party and the Freedom Front plus political party who all consistently and on principle opposed discriminatory behavior by the State to break down the economy and cause harm. ? The ANC?s fascist security crackdown and ensuing economic murder program against the white minority, happened against the background of the white population who were more than willing to do everything in their power, without needing to be forced, to fight the spread of the CCP-virus. ? If there is one thing that this fascist response by the ANC government is proving, it is that if a group like the white minority is not responding to a challenge and crisis in a sufficiently assertive way, it will be removed from the historical scene and will become a footnote in history. All minorities could also learn the lesson that the black majority, or their political representatives, will not ensure their survival, especially in the long term. Minorities will have to do it for themselves. Please share this to raise awareness amongst minorities and overseas.",sa-news,0
"Two Faced Ramaphosa Takes The Low Road of Handouts, Revenge & Flogs The Dead Apartheid Donkey Again, Despite 24 Times More Murders Under ANC Regime Than Apartheid!","Two Wrongs Do Not Make A Right: Choosing the socialist road of enforcing dependency from handouts and victimhood, Ramaphosa, who became a Billionaire simply because he is black, has such a distorted world view, because his billions were just handed to him, he has no concept of what success or viability or sustainability or nationhood is. Like all Socialists, he seems to think the gravy train has no end and he can just keep punishing the hand that feeds him on the gravy train, whilst rewarding those who steal, plunder and vote for socialist grants. Ramaphosa has essentially admitted defeat when it comes to getting South Africa prosperous again, he appears to have no interest in that whatsoever. Cyril Ramaphosa, seems to have changed direction and has moved on from blaming CCPvirus and has gone back to put the blame for South Africa?s imploding economy, before the outbreak of the CCP-virus, squarely on the shoulders of the usual suspect ? ancient history of apartheid. This happened when Ramaphosa verbally answered questions from MP?s during a virtual Parliamentary session. Ramaphosa said, in a very simplistic and blame shifting way, that the reason that our economy was in such an atrocious condition, (even before the longest, hardest and racist lockdown in the world), was that \""apartheid and colonial governments only benefited white people\"". Ramaphosa claimed that is why racist BBBEE legislation, affirmative action and expropriation without compensation will remain as cornerstones of ANC policy \""so that black people can also benefit\"". \""The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy thrust of this government, if anything, needs to be enhanced,\"" he said. Once again it should be noted that Ramaphosa said this in a very simplistic way as if it is beyond doubt that black people never benefited during the last 26 years, in which the ANC was in power and even before. It seems Ramaphosa likes to blank out certain facts to suit his narrative. What Ramaphosa did not do is mention industrial scale looting based on wholesale capture of the state by ANC cadres, the \""transformation \"" of the State sector and government organs to serve and consist of black people only. No blame for the real culprits like BBBEE, the ANC itself, restrictive legislation, over regulation of the labour market and anything that moves, nor the African Way, subsistence black culture or anything else for the country?s problems. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. Just one word needs to be given and it explains all problems and gives ANC immunity from any scrutiny. Apartheid. Apartheid donkey Ramaphosa can only do this because the mainstream media have demonised Apartheid and brainwashed people, even South Africans, to such an extent that they equate apartheid to the Holocaust! Which is an insult to jews! However in reality, blacks in south Africa had the highest standard of living than any blacks in the rest of Africa. Africans were risking their lives everyday trying to sneak INTO aparthied South Africa across crocodile infested rivers! A true comparison would be in cost of human lives: During Shaka Zulu?s dictatorship at least 1 Million people were killed in his 10 year Mfecane genocide, During the last 25 years of black majority rule under Mandela?s ANC, 500,000 people have been killed. During the Second Anglo Boer War, 70,000 people were killed over the 2 years war. Yet during Apartheid only 21,000 people of all races were killed over the entire 42 year period of peace. Do Black Lives not Matter? Shaka genocide Ramaphosa doubled down on his racebaiting and claimed that it must be a \""shame\"" on those who always had power and ownership, alluding to white people, that the country finds itself in such an untenable situation. Again, as if the ANC is blameless. Once again, the fact that the country was handed to them as Africa?s biggest economy, but over the last 26 years under ANC rule slipped to 3rd, are just blanked out. Incredulously, Ramaphosa claimed \""our economy is where it is because the country in the past just focused on a few people and only benefited a few people\"", unless of course he was referring to his ANC cadres plundering the states coffers. Ramaphosa then turned to buzzwords and playing the good guy, claiming the only way forward for South Africa is \""inclusive economic growth\"". He said the \""inclusivity\"" that he is talking about must not be seen as a racially loaded idea and that it must be seen as based on non racialism. Ramaphosa said the aim of the ANC is to change the ownership and control of the economy in an \""inclusive way\"". Ramaphosa yet again even threw some debunked \""facts\"" around ? for instance that white people still owned 72% of farming land, when this is simply not true. Ramaphosa then reinforced his lie and asked (in his reasonable, good guy impersonation): \""if this is fair or must we become more inclusive where everybody owns the land\"". Ramaphosa repeated the lie several times that the ANC is aiming for inclusivity and that white people are not excluded from anything. Ramaphosa told Dr Pieter Groenewald of the VF+ that white people must rather come with suggestions of how to implement inclusivity rather than cling to unfair privileges they always had (apparently to this day according to Ramaphosa). Like we predicted, Ramaphosa also said the Parliamentary ad hoc Committee investigating expropriation without compensation (EWC) should conclude its work so that \""We can see how we should do it\"". Land Typical Ramaphosa, his speech was heavily focused on the narrative, buzzwords and the past. Whilst some naive white people in South Africa, typically your still somewhat privileged suburban liberals, might still be fooled by Ramaphosa in believing that he is the good guy heralding in a departure from the Zuma nightmare, the reality is different. Ramaphosa is in fact a dogmatic ideologue married to ANC policy. He can be compared to a poker player and trickster who will play his game with a straight face, or a big smile, but always playing to win the game on behalf of his organization, the same organization which is without doubt a black supremacist organization, which does not know any other way than to engage in slow racial warfare to achieve its objectives. Robbing Peter to pay Paul so to speak. He is part of an organization that believes that taking from whites is the only way to get something in life, not hard work or growing the economic cake. In short no African country has ever proven that they can build prosperous, humane societies and creating that prosperity on their own. African rulers never fail to become hopelessly corrupt. Ramaphosa will always be the conman who will with a sleight of hand, deception and false narrative, aim to achieve and further the ANC?s objectives. Ramaphosa?s use of buzzwords is aimed at convincing people that he is their friend and the good guy whilst he is actually just furthering the ANC?s core values and programs, based on a slow racial warfare strategy against the white minority ? the so called \""cook the frog slowly in a pot of water\"" strategy, which he admitted decades ago is the ANC?s strategy against the white community. The idea being to take, through incrementalism, everything white people have ever worked for. Presidents are meant to represent all their citizens, but Ramaphosa remains a hardened politician who will always start at the extreme end of the spectrum of political possibilities, knowing there will be some fightback from opponents, but also knowing that the further on the political spectrum he starts, the closer he will end up to his objectives. His custom to invite the white community to make suggestions of how to move forward, is not because he does not have a specific idea already, but to try and cajole whites around to willingly part ways with what they have legitimately worked for. White guilt. It is just part of his negotiation style to get things done. This is merely strategy and the end objective is still to transfer almost all wealth and property belonging to the white community to the state, where ANC cronies can plunder it, in the name of Africanization. But we should always and clearly say, the southern point of Africa never belonged to African tribes in the first place. Other races also have a right to live here Ramaphosa. It can?t be always and forever about your own race, just so the few can benefit over and over. Ramaphosa is playing the permanently disadvantaged game and playing it clearly. This narrative should not be allowed to flourish unchecked, even if liberal globalist media loves it so much. For people not knowing South Africa that well, there are 2 important facts to take note of. First the State sector and all State Owned Organizations are almost fully black staffed by an official policy of \""cadre deployment\"" immaterial of skill or merit. In true socialist style, the national racial demographic profile of the country is also being enforced on all medium and large companies in the private sector. The second important thing to take note of is that the ANC used the CCP-virus pandemic as racial warfare opportunity to achieve political objectives. They for instance enforced the longest and strictest lockdown in the world but discriminated on the basis of race and refused to include any white small business in official State financial help packages. They even tried to close non governmental organizations distributing food in white areas and did not give a single food parcel to any poor white family, even those in squatter camps. The racial conduct of the ANC during the lockdown amounts to crimes against humanity, not just extreme racist and fascist behavior.",sa-news,0
"South Africa Overtakes China in Covid19 Infections! Was Ramaphosa Too Harsh, Too Soon, Too Long? Does it Even Matter?","South Africa is now in the 20th spot for Corona Virus infections globally and has surged past that psychological milestone of overtaking China?s infection numbers, where it all started. Thankfully, the deaths, (that we know of), are comparatively low, which has probably contributed to a certain amount of apathy from media & government. Mainstream media & ANC government were more concerned about importing far left propaganda from USA, about a drug addicted, black porn actor, who accidentally died while violently resisting arrest. Coverage of gender violence was also prioritized, given that SA is a world \""leader\"" in most types of violence. People are also desperate to receive the Covid19 aid Ramaphosa & ANC so lavishly promised, but they should know better than to believe marxists. Whoever Ramaphosa?s handlers are, they seem to have got just about everything wrong when it comes to response to the Covid19 pandemic. Had they paid attention, or had they listened to the scientists they would have known that the response should be proportional, and coming down so hard, so fast, for so long was the worst thing to do! UK knew this and Prime Minister Boris Johnson even discussed publicly the issue of citizens losing their enthusiasm, appetite and tolerance for combating the virus. So despite all Ramaphosa pre written speeches, to whip up the mass enthusiasm, it made no difference at all ot the figures, because the ANC was too draconian, killing a mosquito with a cricket bat, South Africa is now up the river without a paddle or anything left in reserve in its arsenal. People are gatvol and have no interest in lockdown or social distancing. They are hungry, without much money, and still the infection rates are rising at a faster pace, and winter is here? Many people have complained about not receiving the special Social Relief Distress Grant, which is for people who had no income during lockdown, and some applications are still pending, while many others have been rejected. SASSA says it?s managed to pay out only 3.2 million people but many have expressed their dissatisfaction, saying they have been waiting for two months now. It is back to business for law enforcement with the arrest of the VBS bank fraudsters, people have also been out to protest an imported problem, because really, SA has had a black majority government for a quarter of a century, with full power, BBBEE and control of everything, so to try pretend that the problems of South Africa today are somehow white people?s fault, is pure opportunism! SA-News however provided an alternative statue protest calling for the removal of Shaka?s statue, which reached nearly 200,000 people on Facebook: Take Down Shaka Statue However, as we have reported a few times, it is clear the ANC have been more interested in capitalising and profiting from the Covid19 pandemic than combating it, and all their sanctimonious speeches and decrees have been targeted at manipulating people into a more totalitarian regime. In future we will all be talking about how it was before CCPvirus, how free we were and how we could do this and that without needing a permit or being watched. The minorities more so because ANC has now openly had its anti white policies condoned by the constitutional court, so expropriation of land without compensation will be fast tracked soon. South Africa is now in uncharted territory, not only politically, but economically and healthwise too. Northern hemisphere countries were helped by the onset of summer in their battle against CCPvirus, although they lost many lives. South Africa still has winter ahead of it and it has not reached the peak of its healthcare capacity yet, and people have no appetite for lockdown or social distancing anymore, and all Ramaphosa has is speeches. The ANC regime has its work cut out for it, but with Bheki Cele happy to smash force people into line, with total disregard for accusations of police brutality, there is a showdown looming. NDZ has also been playing the long game, no doubt her canny ex husband has advised her to drag it out, so that Ramaphosa can take all the blame for the disaster that the CCPvirus response is fast becoming? then replacing him will be as easy as pie, and South Africa will find itself with a fully fledged communist government, like Venezuela or Cuba, or China, where it all started?

"\""Ramaphosa is The Bastard\""  Will VBS Arrests Destroy EFF? ANC & EFF Marxists Indulge in Looted Capitalist Luxuries With No Accountability!","If you were hoping that finally, after yesterday?s arrest of 8 officials in the VBS Bank heist, that the racist motormouths of Malema & bullyboy Shivambu were going to get their comeuppance, due to their close links to the looted 2 Billion Rand, you have not been paying attention. SA is run by a corrupt regime and corruption can only exist where there is no accountability, and where deniability is readily accepted to the extreme. Despite dates and locations on his Twitter trail mirroring his Mahuna bank card withdrawals, over a whole year, Malema STILL denies knowing anything! You can be sure, in his defense, Malema?s motormouth will accelerate way beyond just calling Ramaphosa a \""bastard\"", supposedly for not bailing him out of this mess? When hundreds of desperate people queued in panic for days in June 2018, at the HQ of VBS Mutual Bank in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, hoping to withdraw their life?s savings from the failing bank, the \""people?s hero\"" Julius Malema was still happily using his Mahuna Investments bank card to spend money looted from VBS Bank, which \""lost\"" nearly 2 Billion! Malema spent R900,000 that month alone! From December 2017 to December 2018, Julius Malema the Marxist, spent 4 Million rand buying capitalist brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Emporio Armani, Le Coq Sportif, Durban July, etc. If that contradiction is not bad enough, the fact that it was stolen money from a slush fund should make one seriously wonder if marxism is not just a front for greedy power hungry criminals, which is why it never works, no matter how may times citizens are tricked by its false idealistic promises. Is this what the EFF & ANC mean by nationalisation of banks? Into their pockets? The reason why it is tried time and again however, is because quite frankly, for criminals, it is the best cover there is and usually it also lets them get away with it, pretending it was a political coup, or smear campaign, or they didn?t know, or they were framed, and already the EFF propaganda machine is claiming just that! Because marxism usually operates in a regime which is rotten from the very top to the very bottom, the criminals pretending to be politicians, usually are not prosecuted either, and they are allowed to push their deniability or bluster to the extreme. Then if it looks like they might just end up being found guilty, there is always the medical health card to play. Proof of the absolute corrupt regime, was the fact that a suspect in this major criminal case, Floyd Shivambu, who is also a member of Parliament, the deputy leader of a major political party, is having private communications with the head of the Hawks, Godfrey Lebeya that is supposedly investigating him! Floyd Shivambu?s brother has an engineering company which received R16 Million from VBS Bank yet they cannot show which services it provided in return for the funds. One thing is for certain, after two decades of plunder, corruption, looting, lying and blatant state capture, you are a realist, not a cynic for assuming that no high level politician is going to jail just yet. We look forward to find out just to what extent Ramaphosa left Malema out in the cold. It appears Ramaphosa feels he no longer needs Malema as an ally for land expropriation without compensation. What is shocking though, is this pattern of corruption and rapid distribution of large sums of cash, without accountability, has been repeated many times over in the last 26 years, resulting in the deliberate hollowing out of a once first world country, which ironically is an aim of marxism too. Indeed, Malema might still have the last laugh, as Africans have a tendency to elevate the biggest criminals, like Mugabe, their \""Lion of Africa.\"" ",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: \""We Muslims are the New Black People of America!\""  Blacks Being Brainwashed into Attacking Whites for Islams Global Jihad!","BLM is currently more popular than both the Republican and Democrat Parties in America! While white South Africans are used to racebaiting and being attacked and blamed for everything, the ramp up in the africanisation of USA (and Europe) has taken Americans by surprise. So who is paying for and stoking this race war? It is clear to even the most cucked or uninterested observer, that something is going on. Over the last few years the well funded \""anti-racism\"" campaign has become so militant and aggressive, that it is now the epitome of structural and systemic racism itself! Yet still protected and is pushed further and further left, and now the Council of Islamic American Relations (CAIR) comes out openly admitting that they have hijacked the Black Lives Matter movement! This should not be a shock to the well informed, because we already know Muslim Brotherhood in Europe has been heavily funding the \""anti-racism\"" movement and antifa. Are Muslims in South Africa also secretly using blacks to attack whites? So who is using blacks as cannon fodder in a proxy war? Jews? Zionists? Communists? Russia? NWO Globalist Capitalists? Chinese? Muslims? Arabs? All of these certainly have the resources, influences, funding, networks and global supremacist ambition to ally with, and brainwash blacks into attacking whites like never seen before, and most of them probably do to some extent. While the historic wrongs of whites are rehashed and used time and again as justification for equally heinous crimes today, the wrongs of others are ignored and rewritten. Two wrongs do not make a right! It will just make history repeat itself. Point is it does not matter any more who is stoking it, because it will not stop until whites wake up, stand up and put a stop to it, just like whites put a stop to slavery. It appears the other races are only interested in global supremacy! Watch: NOT FOR SENSITIVE VIEWERS: Watch video here if it does not load above: https://www.bitchute.com/video/VlcCFmMkwMdM/ Unfortunately the one group that has very little funds, very little influence and no network, is the one being attacked, castigated and blamed for it all? the patriotic whites?. who just want a piece of land to raise their family mostly? oh and go to space? but the globalists have already declared that no homogeneous population will be allowed to exist anywhere on earth. I am sure China, India and Africa have something to say about that?

Electricity Network Threatened by Illegal Connections & Plundered Municipalities Like MaLOOTi-a-Poefie Which Owes Eskom R5.2 Billion!,"Much like Champagne Socialists, #TheAfricanWay also seems to be party until taxpayer?s money runs out, then blame the whites! The Free State is a perfect example of what Trump meant with the term sh*thole, with plundered into bankruptcy municipalities, like Mangat-in, MaLOOTi-a-Poefie and Meteens-soos-myholo being perfect examples of where South Africa as a whole is headed. The National Council of Provinces, which is yet another useless trough eating quango (created purely to extract salaries, fees and expenses), is going to visit the Malooti-a-Poefie municipality in the Free State. The municipality is responsible for the MISmanagement and looting of the Harrismith, Kestell and QuaQua areas. As small as it is, Malooti-a-Poefie owes Eskom a massive R 5, 2 Billion and electricity is stolen on such a large scale, that it is feared that the network could totally collapse. The decision to take the field trip, was taken in a virtual meeting (online) when 3 municipalities of the Free State, all 3 plundered into administration, appeared before the National Council of Provinces (NCP). Joining Malooti-a-Poefie was the Mangat-in (Bloemfontein) and Meteens-soos-myholo (Sasolburg). Please note the spelling of these \""radically transformed\"" entities. Transformed means no whites, black run and looted into bankruptcy in the ANC jargon. As SA-News recently reported that Malooti-a-Poefie?s sewage treatment plant hasn?t been working for months and that the sewage just runs through it untreated, mixing with blood from the abattoir, flowing into the Wilge river until it reaches the Vaal dam. Amos Goliath, administrator of Malooti, told the NCP that Malooti?s income was also R60 million less in April due to the lockdown. The NCP also indicated that it wants to visit Meteens-soos-myholo which last held an ordinary council meeting a year ago. The 3 municipalities that appeared before the NCP comprises a population which is almost 70% of the Free State population. The Welkom municipality was not before the NCP, although it also owes Billions to Eskom and Sedibeng Water. Welkom was not placed under administration yet. SA-News has asked before, why can?t consumers pay their bills direct to Eskom to prevent criminal councilors pocketing it? The current administrator of Malooti, Amos Goliath, told the NCP virtual meeting that the crux of the problem facing his looted shell of a municipality, is that the current mayor, speaker and chief whip of the council, resisted his own and his predecessor administrator?s efforts, because they wanted illegal tenders and appointments to go through. And so another useless exercise was concluded because all the NCP will do is draw up a report and visit the municipalities. They did not say when because it seems it is still. #LockdownForever. The same NCP meeting also heard that the ANC controlled Bloemfontein Metro (Mangat-in) , which has an executive mayor with a huge salary, the corrupt to the bone Olly Mlamleli, as well as an administrator appointed by the Province, plans to increase rates and taxes by a percentage point which is above inflation on 1 July. The DA has noted that this is despite the fact that the salary account for officials has increased with R400 Million per year since Mlamleli took over as mayor. Typical ANC, the more they steal, the more cadres they appoint and the less services they deliver. It is a system of the tyranny of the majority made possible by the black majority voters, no doubt about that. Mlamleli has also told the National Council of Provinces that the Bloemfontein Metro has no long term financial plan and is waiting for the Treasury to help with this. The Bloemfontein Metro now wants to save on various items. For instance it has not budgeted any money for the Metro Police for the next financial year. This is now the same Metro Police which has not been created yet, although they have appointed a head for the force who they now have to pay a salary although he has no personnel yet. While the Metro Police head has no personnel, he has a Nyala personnel riot vehicle to his disposal which they bought through the third party middleman, Mothebe Wheels at way above what the factory asks for it. Centlec, which is the Bloemfontein Metro?s electricity distributor, has not submitted a budget yet. The legacy of Ace Magashule, the current ANC Secretary General, and former Free State Premier lives on. It really does seem that the Free State faces total ruin and that there is just not any possible solutions anymore except to hide behind the \""apartheid?s fault\"" excuse, or is it Trump?s fault now? We should not be surprised. Everything in South Africa will end up like this. It is #TheAfricanWay.",sa-news,0
#ReclaimTheRainbow LGBT is neo-Bolshevism and More Destructive Than Communism  Polish President Duda,"Poland?s President Andrzej Duda has said LGBT \""ideology\"" is like the communism his parent?s generation fought, and warned that with its bid to indoctrinate the youth, this \""neo-Bolshevism\"" is even more harmful and destructive. He has taken a firm stance against the EU?s liberal imperialism during his pre-election campaign and vowed to protect children from the \""foreign ideology of LGBT.\"" The popular politician, who is seeking re-election, spoke to an audience at a Saturday rally where he said that his parents? generation did not fight communism only to bow down to a new \""ideology\"" that is \""even more destructive to the human being.\"" While such straight talk would have definitely caused the end to a politician?s career in most captured \""liberalised\"" western countries, in Poland, where family values, common decency and a normal desire to have children is still the norm, it?s likely to fetch Duda votes from many conservative minded Polish. Throwing Bolshevism, which is largely responsible for the Russian revolution and death of millions, into the mix, appears to be a wise move as well, given that Poland?s tragic experiences from being in the Soviet bloc has been a hot political topic over the last three decades: That was Bolshevism. It was the ideologizing of children. Today, there are also attempts to push an ideology on us and our children, but different. It?s totally new, but it is also neo-Bolshevism. We all know that propaganda cannot exist without technology, and so the fight against the \""LGBT technology\"" seems to be one of the cornerstones of Duda?s campaign. Earlier this week, he made several campaign promises, including that, as president, he will continue to protect family values. The pledges also contain a special focus on \""Protecting children from LGBT ideology.\"" Duda?s allies from the ruling Law and Justice party have made bold anti-LGBT statements, as well. Deputy head of the party, Joachim Brudzinski, went even further than Duda, stating that \""Poland without LGBT is [a] most beautiful\"" sight. Poland is heading for a presidential election, scheduled for June 28, and Duda is taking a solid lead in the polls with around 40 percent support. His main rival, left wing liberal politician Rafal Trzaskowski, who is currently serving as the embattled Mayor of Warsaw, is dragging behind with some 28 percent support. Still, to secure the win in the first round, a candidate needs to get the support of just over a half of voters and the country is likely heading for two-rounds of voting. While his his stance is in stark contrast to the EU?s liberal far left pro LGBT stance, Andrzej Duda is seeking a second term as the President of Poland from the ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. On Wednesday, he signed up to several campaign promises, including that, as president, he will continue to be a staunch protector of family values.",sa-news,0

This self appointed judge, jury and executioner attitude is systemic and endemic to the establishment and left wingers. The world is suffering from the results of decades of over the top tolerance which has been more appeasement and freebie indulgence than tolerance, resulting in a attitude of entitlement. Far left groups like antifa and Black Lives Matter have hijacked the George Floyd protests and many have seized the moment as an opportunity to oust Trump and win back momentum for the Liberal World Order. Gary McFarlane, the prominent member of the far left Socialist Workers Party (SWP) who condoned the shooting of allegedly \""racist\"" police officers, claimed on television to be a Black Lives Matter organiser calling for \""revolution.\"" He even criticised the police officer who was knocked off her horse at a demonstration in Downing Street. Attacking the victim. We live in a dystopian world where children block their own parents on social media because \""racism\""! The far left overseas, and in South Africa, have made heavy use of social media, communications platforms like Zoom and also the Dark Web, which their more perverted members frequent, to organise and make it appear as if the protests were organic, yet they were anything but grassroots uprisings. In the same way the suppression and denial of farm murders and farm attacks in SA is orchestrated and deliberate. Left wing journalists congregate in the same places, have relationships with each other, work for more than one outlet and as a result they can collude and manufacture the impression that everyone agrees, that farm murders don?t happen or are not driven by racial hatred. Even the rise so-called \""black-twitter\"" and a despicable facebook group that aims to attack victims and whistle blowers of farm murders, is proof of how orchestrated it is. Left wing NGOs and Groups like Groundup, funded by globalist Oligarchs like George Soros (Open Foundation) and London jew, Tony Tabatznik (Bertha Foundation), etc., not only organise and orchestrate violent protests, they then write articles about these protests and mainstream media like NASPERS, The Argus, The Star, etc. etc. dutifully broadcast these biased articles as if they are actual community protests! Does South Africa not care about foreign meddling in SA politics? They have to orchestrate it because the statistics and evidence states overwhelmingly that blacks have a higher tendency to violence than whites. Full stop. The perpetrators of South Africa?s 56 murders a day are almost exclusively black. Fact. While mainstream media try to hide it, even threatening SA-News with legal action (NASPERS & Caxton) for publishing details of farm murders, which they claim to \""own\"", the horrific and damning evidence is there for anyone willing to look outside the mainstream echo chamber. Imagine trying to take ownership of and profit from details of farm murders? Other outlets like MyBroadband slander SA-News by listing us as fake news, as part of their concerted attempt to protect their mainstream advertising revenue by ignoring the harsh truths. Likewise in America in the last few weeks, we have even seen videos on social media of black gangs going out \""hunting whitey\"" and brutally beating up any innocent whitey they come across! If that is not black supremacism then what is? Unfortunately no one knows about it because the complicit mainstream establishment bury it. So it is clear white lives do not matter to the globalists and communists who have agitated and brainwashed the black masses into hating and attacking whites en masse ? literally stoking a race war. A race war that has secretly been going on in South Africa for decades, as these latest examples prove: A black attacker hacked elderly Eduard Neumeister (67) into pieces with a panga on his kitchen floor! The attack happened last Saturday morning 6 June, 2020 on a farm at Balgowan, KZN Midlands. Edi was the owner of Edi?s Bratwurst Sausage Restaurant and B&B. The attacker also attacked Edi?s fiancee Margit Riebler and Edi fought to protect his fiancee. Then the black attacker started to hack Edi before he fled. Paramedics and Police members on the scene said they never saw such horrific injuries. The incident has been picked up by European media because Edi was an Austrian by birth. His son Tommy stays in Germany. Incidents like these only make the news overseas when foreign nationals are involved. Yet there have been many thousands of white people murdered on farms in South Africa since the violent ANC were handed power, in thousands of attacks. Agricultural union TLU SA has recently published farm attack statistics kept internally by them since 1990, with their records indicating 5,437 farm attacks on their members since 1990 and 2,067 farm murders. These are only statistics they could gather from their own members. Not all farmers belong to TLU SA, so the real number of farm attacks and murders are much higher. These attacks are actively encouraged by ANC and EFF politicians on a regular basis with their constant anti white hate speech. Many white children and women were also murdered in these attacks, many white people horrifically tortured and many women raped. It amounts to a slow racial war encouraged by the ANC and EFF. But this is just the tip of the iceberg as we have not even looked at deliberate negligence of whites in state hospitals and civil service. In fact tens of thousands of white people were murdered, raped and maimed by black men since the ANC took over, with very few black people murdered by whites, which is the global norm. All murders are wrong and intolerable. But why is the onslaught against South African whites ignored by the world and liberal media and only white on black incidents played up? This is clearly part of an agenda and the Black Lives Matter campaign should be called out for what it is ? like LGBT, antifa, feminists, etc, they are a weapon to destabilize communities in order to allow communists and the Liberal World Order to take power and oust Trump, because clearly they are not going to be able to do it via the ballot box. This after all is how the ANC won the elections with such a large margin since 1994! On May 25 the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Police custody in the USA was hijacked by the globalist movement to elevate the incident to a rallying cry for globalist social unrest, with the hijackers driving a black supremacist and Far Left agenda. The political and revolutionary nature of this #fauxrage warrants a look at black on white violence in South Africa, in the same week as the George Floyd riots. This is a factual report and without going into the details of the George Floyd death while resisting arrest, or historical injustices that have been done to any people in the world. This report simply looks at the facts and the hypocrisy of liberal media in South Africa and the world, which specifically mentions ex police officer Chauvin?s race as white, but never mentions the race of the attackers of white people in reports in South Africa. Again this is a factual report and you will have to draw your own conclusions. ROLL CALL FOR VICTIMS OF BLACK ON WHITE VIOLENCE IN SOUTH AFRICA IN THE TIME OF THE GEORGE FLOYD #FAUXRAGE AND GLOBALIST RIOTING AGITATION. ? 1 June 2020 ? Community medical doctor Roelof Botha (59) stabbed to death with sheep shears by a group of black attackers in a nature reserve in Tulbach , Western Cape. Botha stayed on a farm in the area. Community medical doctor Roelof Botha ? 2 June 2020 ? Tinus Pretorius (37) shot 4 times and left in a critical condition in his Klerksdorp shop. ? 4 June 2020 ? Kobie Smit (60) and his wife Annie Smit (58) were seriously injured when a black man attacked them with a panga on Thursday at around 18:00 in the neighbourhood Panorama, Bethlehem, Free State province. Kobie was outside in his yard when the black man chopped him with the panga, walked past him and also chopped Annie inside the house with the panga. The man fled without taking anything and the couple?s neighbour discovered them and rushed them to hospital. ? 4 June 2020 ? In a second incident in Bethlehem on the same day, a black man broke a window of a house where a 60 year old woman and her daughter were watching TV at around 21:15. The man stabbed the older woman in the neck, grabbed a laptop and fled with it through the same window . She survived the incident. ? The previous week a 86 year old woman was attacked and raped, also in Bethlehem town. She heard a window break and was surprised by a black male attacker who detained her with a knife, cut her clothes off with it and then raped her. He stole money and groceries before fleeing. ? 5 June 2020 ? Pieter Nel (65) was left in critical condition after he was shot twice on his farm in Hartbeespoort on Friday, 5 June. His wife Ann was seriously assaulted. ? 6 June 2020 ? An elderly white couple, Schalk (63) and Lana Coetzee (59), were also severely assaulted on a farm outside Reivilo, Northern Cape on Saturday 6 June, 2020. The man was left in critical condition. His attackers, black men, poured boiling water on his back. Both had to undergo surgery afterwards. This image of a bloodied Lana Coetzee was sent into the world: Farm Attack ? 9 Jun 2020 ? Mike Sebanz (52) shot in the stomach by armed robbers and he later died in the Tembisa hospital. He and another staff member were guarding the Kempton Park golf club during the night. They worked in the bar. Mike Sebanz ? 11 June 2020 ? A top medical specialist had his skull cracked by crowbar wielding black home invaders in Somerset West around midnight. ? Many more less serious farm attacks happened during this time where white residents were nevertheless assaulted for instance in Nelspruit, Barberton, Cradock and Vanwyksvlei. ? During May 2020 there were 15 farm attacks and 4 farm murders reported. ? During April 2020 there were 17 farm attacks and one farm murder reported. ? During March 2020 there were 35 farm attacks and 6 farm murders reported. ? During Feb 2020 there were 31 farm attacks and 8 farm murders reported. All these incidents came amidst the longest and hardest CCP-virus lockdown in the world, implemented in South Africa at the end of March. Ridiculous rules and regulations were forced on South Africans and almost a quarter of a million of South Africans were arrested for trivialities and given criminal records when they paid the admission of guilt fine. The ANC gave state financial assistance to only some small businesses forced to close during the lockdown, but only if the owners were black. No food parcels were given by the ANC government to white people in need although there were many, for instance a whole small impoverished town called Venterspos in Gauteng, which is extremely poor and where the little income there vanished due to the lockdown. The lockdown is happening amidst an ANC government which is looting on an industrial scale through capturing the State through it?s cadre deployment policy and causing collapsing infrastructure like sewage treatment plants. Four male residents of Koster in North West died on 5 June 2020 when they tried to open a blocked sewage pipe and were overpowered by sewage gasses. The local ANC run municipality collapsed a long time ago and does not render services anymore. The men who died were Chris Pretorius, Connie Cloete and 2 black men employed by Chris namely Mpho Melatho and Lennox Thobeni. Afriforum also had to lay hate speech charges against the guardians of the legacy of Nelson Mandela after the Nelson Mandela Foundation made the following remarks on 10 June : \""The use of violence can be rational and carefully targeted as part of a strategy to counter structural and other forms of violence against Black lives. And, of course, it ought always to be so.\"" The press release by the Nelson Mandela Foundation seems carefully aimed at giving consent to violence to be used in the liberal ? globalist revolution which was long planned with George Soros as chief financier. Of course the globalist Alliance seized upon the death of George Floyd to elevate him to icon status and pick up the pace of globalist conquest. Nelson Mandela is regarded as an icon so if his foundation gives consent to violence it wil be seen as legitimate violence taking into account that Nelson Mandela, admitted to authorising the killing of some 160 people yet has been elevated to saint status by the world ? although he is certainly co-responsible for the filthy dictatorship the ANC has turned South Africa into, because he must have been aware what kind of party of outright criminals he was presiding over. The world should be ashamed the day when the extent of structural discrimination against the white minority by a black government of South Africa becomes known. But then hindsight is 20/20 only after the genocide is complete, only then will they pretend ignorance and shock of the violent attacks, atrocities and deliberate negligence committed by blacks on whites in South Africa.

"Harrismiths Dysfunctional \""MaLOOTi-a-Poefie\"" Municipality Leaves Sewage & Blood Flowing into Field, River & Vaal Dam After Treatment Plant Stripped for Scrap!","South Africa is literally being stolen and sold for scrap! In Harrismith there are no sewage works anymore. It lays stripped and looted bare, sold for scrap, leaving the town?s sewage, and blood from the abattoir, flowing into the field and then into the rivers and the Vaal Dam! Truly and demonstratively #TheAfricanWay Harrismith, which falls under the Maluti-a-Phofung municipality (dubbed \""MaLOOTi-a-Poefie\""), has been without a working sewage treatment plant for months, after it has been systematically stripped and looted by scrap thieves. The looted components include the cables and electrical transformer, rendering the treatment plant 100% useless and out of order. The embattled mayor of Maluti A Phofung, Vusi Tshabalala, the Chief Whip Mmoledi Moloi and the Speaker Malewatle Nthedi were recalled back in 2018 by the ANC after the municipality, like so many others, was placed under administration . The current Executive Mayor is Cllr Masetjhaba Lakaje Mosia. Willem Konig, a director of the local Harrismith/Intabazwe/Tshiame taxpayers association, told Maroela Media he can?t even begin to explain the ecological disaster that is facing Harrismith at the moment. Konig confirms the main sewage treatment plant is totally dysfunctional. He says the raw sewage that makes it to the plant just runs straight through the plant and flows into the Wilge River on the other side, and then into the Vaal dam. There are also blockages at sewage pipes leading to the main treatment plant. Blood that comes from the local abattoir is also landing in the field, because the sewage treatment plant is not working and this situation is not the abattoir?s fault, it is simply because the sewage treatment plant is broken. Konig says his taxpayers association has sent a lawyers letter to the municipality, and if they don?t receive satisfactory answers they will approach the High Court to obtain a court order to force the municipality to do their (very well paid) jobs. Konig says criminal charges in terms of appropriate laws will also be laid (doubtful if it will help but we wish them good luck). Konig says residents have pleaded for months that the municipality must do maintenance work and fix the plant but nothing was done. It unfortunately seems the Free State government has run out will to find solutions. The province was systematically stripped, looted and bankrupted under the ANC cadre rule of Ace Magashule, and it just seems totally improbable that a court will force these thieves to stop stealing, and it also seems just totally improbable that the cadre run and \""transformed ? THAT MEANS BLACK ? officialdom will start doing what they are paid and elected to do. ",sa-news,0
"ANC Nanny State is Here to Stay! Covid19 Proved ANC Ignores Scientists, Have No Trust in the People & Prefer Total Power, Control & Dictatorship!","People said it was just a \""conspiracy theory\"" that Government could lock you up, take away your income, make you completely dependent on them and control every move you make, control what and when and how you eat, buy things or go out! The worst part is they are doing it with something we cannot even see or touch! Just one speech to the nation and kerchink! Lockdown! Economy Closed! Once the ANC realised what an obedient country we are, they quickly moved to implement more totalitarian plans, and cherry picked which scientist or advisers recommendations they would pretend to follow, when in reality they just used advice from advisers that agreed with their predetermined big brother path, to manufacture consent. However, this path where poverty is caused by the lockdown, will kill, according to a PANDA businessman. Russell Lamberti, a businessman and PANDA member, says the economic contraction caused by the lockdown will cause loss of life. The poverty caused by the lockdown will kill he says. Lamberti says that the loss to the country?s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will be 10-15 %, a loss of about R 500 Billion. Lamberti estimates the loss in tax income to between R200 ? R400 Billion. To add some perspective, Lamberti says that during the worldwide financial recession of 2008, South Africa?s GDP only shrunk by 2%. Lamberti questions the apparent approach the government has, which is to collapse the economy so that they can remake it after its collapse, to give a bigger portion of the economy to the black population (an even bigger slice because due to the ANC?s BBBEE policy, whites were cut out from the formal economy already.) Lamberti says that the lockdown is like a sledgehammer that will kill the organism sustaining life. Lamberti says that contrary to what Marxists believe, employers and workers alike will manage their own environments because nobody wants to die after all and business people will come with their own smart solutions to keep people safe. Lamberti says there is only one thing that can be done now and that is to abolish the lockdown and allow people to work. Experts are now saying that the hardest, most dictatorial and longest lockdown in the world implemented right here in South Africa, was an enormous overreaction and giant mistake after the outbreak of the CCP-virus. They are also saying that more people will die from the broken economy flowing from the lockdown than will die from the CCP- virus itself. This very important and true assertion is made by a group of experts called PANDA (Pandemic Data & Analysis). They are a group of experts who are trying to convince the ANC of the fallacy of the lockdown and the incorrectness of the apocalyptic initial computer models on which the ANC say they based their hard lockdown on. Knowing the ANC, one has to asked why SACEMA was chosen to do the modeling? The ANC however is not listening, even though every day that the lockdown is continuing it is creating more jobless people and more small businesses to close. The ANC is clearly keeping themselves deaf and quite obviously they have other political objectives to reach. Nick Hudson, an actuary and co-ordinator of PANDA, points out that the government says they based the hard lockdown on wild predictions that up to 360,000 people would die of the CCP-virus. Those predictions were made by a group of academics at the University of Stellenbosch called SACEMA. PANDA says this is simply wrong and they estimate the death toll will be around 10,000. The question is now how many people in South Africa will eventually die because of the effects of the lockdown? Hudson warns that many lockdown related factors like people not doing cancer and TB tests, vaccinations that are falling behind, and even eventually child malnutrition which will eventually contribute to the lockdown related deaths, not even to mention people who die from increased crime and despair factors like committing suicide, because they lose their ability to make a living. Hudson says there is no proof any place in the world that a lockdown can flatten the CCP-virus curve, especially in a place like South Africa. Hudson says that what we have seen so far worldwide was insane. Even if 500,000 people die from the CCP-virus worldwide, it has to be seen against the backdrop of a world population of 7,8 billion people. Ian McGorian, another PANDA member, who is a mathematician and statistics analyst, says that SACEMA predicted the number of deaths caused by the CCP ? virus by using an infection rate of up to 40% which is way off the mark. Even in the two most affected CCP-virus affected countries, Italy and Spain, the infection rate was only 2,5 % of the population. McGorian says he believes there should not have been any lockdown in South Africa. So why was there this lunatic over-reaction and deliberate creation of fear worldwide? To have some perspective brought by the passing of time since the CCP-virus broke out, it is important to note that the CCP- virus is an additional sickness in the world, not the only cause of death in the world. People die all the time and from many causes, also of old age. When the pandemic broke out, some academics at universities all over the world drew up computer models that predicted that an apocalyptic number of people would die. This was partially cause because no-one trusted the Chines Communist Party numbers coming out of Wuhan where the pandemic started. These computer models were proved wrong over time and today it is clear as daylight that the CCP-virus mainly causes some older people and people with comorbidities to die if they contract the virus. Governments all over the world saw a lockdown as the only answer to \""flatten the curve\"". A country like Sweden did not agree and had almost no lockdown measures. Today it is clear that lockdowns don?t work, so why is it still in place? Whether countries have lockdowns or not, over time roughly the same percentage of the population die from the CCP- virus. Scientists now agree that no lockdown can prevent the CCP ? virus from spreading, all it does is help the government look good by not challenging their healthcare system. The longer the lockdown dragged on, it became clear that it was the Radical Left and Globalist Alliance that wanted to keep countries in lockdown. In South Africa it was no different with the ANC driving the hard lockdown and the EFF supporting them. It seems the world over the Radical Left wanted to break the economy and small business owners to remake the world economy in the socialist image. The world over globalist supporting elite became richer and ordinary people poorer. Much poorer. If we look specifically at the situation in South Africa, the madness becomes clear. Whilst schools and other infrastructure like train stations were standing abandoned, they were looted and carried away brick by brick and cable by cable. If you thought South Africa was broken before, you got no idea how much we are broken now. But by the time news of that destruction starts to filter out, the ANC will be back to bashing whites to divert attention from what they did. It is total madness to think the world overreacted like this. An initial overreaction can be understood because the situation was new but as new info became available, the approach should have been adjusted. This was not done because too many people, driven on by the liberal media and globalist elite, were capitalising on the pandemic and inducing a psychosis of fear, creating a false pandemic of fear based on vastly overblown estimates of people expected to die. The political motive of fear mongering should never be forgotten. This is how ideologues achieve their objectives, by scaring us, or trying to get rid of Trump. This is why liberal media and the Radical Left want to keep on keeping us in fear. Share if you don?t mind please, so that we can bring sanity back. ",sa-news,0
SA Police Three Times More Deadly Than US Police! Black Lives Dont Matter to the Black ANC Government with a Record Far Worse Than Apartheid!,"#BlackLivesDoNotMatter in South Africa: The deadly police brutality record of South African Police Service (SAPS) is more than 3 times worse than that of the USA Police Force, which is currently causing so much politically correct outrage in the mainstream. Indeed, SA has a police record that is not only embarrassing, but is also a disgrace and is far worse than in any of the apartheid era. In fact the the same amount of people (mostly black) are murdered in SA every year, under the ANC regime, as what were murdered in over 40 years of Apartheid government! So do black lives really matter in SA under ANC? Shockingly, in the 2017/18 financial year, the deaths of 759 people could be linked to the police ? 201 died while in police custody, while 558 people died as a result of police action. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) 2017/18 annual report painted a grim picture as police brutality complaints increased, and 43 on-duty police officers came under investigation for rape, eight more than a year earlier. This compares to an average of around 1,000 deaths by police brutality in USA per year, but USA has 5 times the population that SA does (320 Million), so in reality SAPS police brutality record is 3.5 times worse than USA in absolute numbers! It has also been revealed that more than 30,000 incidents of police brutality have been reported between 2014 and 2019. While this large number over the last 6 years, make one think the SAPS are a cruel and hate-filled bunch of sadistic police officers, who should all be fired, the complaints of police brutality are not as high in SA as in the USA, and with 3 times more deaths by police brutality in SA, we can only imagine why there are not as many complaints. There are also 99 cases of people being raped in police detention, all of this making South Africa a far greater perpetrator of police violence than any other African country. Fewer than 4% of police brutality charges resulted in disciplinary action, and only 1.3% of cases were criminally prosecuted in SA, while in USA about 1% are prosecuted. In the USA, according to 2016 FBI data, black men commit murder 572.8% more than what white men do. Rapes are committed at a level of 146.1% greater by blacks than whites, robbery is at 617.9% greater than whites, aggravated assault at 203.3% greater and violent crime in total at 263.6% greater by blacks. One would expect these percentages to be far higher in SA due to the demographic breakdown. After the recent astounding revelation that police brutality increased by about 30% in the first month of the pandemic lockdown restrictions, calls for the mafioso Minister of Police, Bheki Cele to resign or be replaced by someone more competent, have been getting louder, especially since the recent spate of deaths by police brutality during the lockdown, but the ANC does what it wants and ignores the people. In one such infamous case, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), has recommended that disciplinary steps should be taken against five of the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers, and the two police officers that were allegedly involved in the death of Collins Khosa. A report states that the JMPD members had neglected their legal obligations, when they stood by as Khosa and his family were being assaulted by SANDF members, while the recommendation for the police is in connection with the contravention of the disciplinary regulations. Khosa was allegedly assaulted by members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) during the nationwide lockdown when they saw a half consumed glass of beer in his yard. Court papers state that the SANDF members then kicked and punched Khosa, holding his hands behind his back while they choked and beat him, slammed him against the wall, and used the butt of a machine gun to hit him, apparently resulting in him dying from blunt force trauma to the head. Shockingly an investigation by the SANDF board of inquiry, cleared the soldiers of any wrongdoing in Khosa?s death, saying there was no link between his injuries and the actions of the army. However, according to News24, the EFF has also stepped into the fray and will challenge the result of the investigation by the SANDF. IPID?s legal advisors had recommended that an investigation be conducted and the second investigation sought to determine the involvement of JMPD officers in the incident. It saw the establishment of a task team of senior investigators who interviewed witnesses, including four new witnesses, five JMPD officials and three police officials. The witnesses told IPID investigastors they were assaulted for recording the incident, saying they saw members of the army assault Khosa and his brother-in-law, Thabiso Mavhungo. This is not the first time the police or army has been accused of deleting footage of their crimes. The JMPD officials made no mention of the assault, only claiming that they had met up with the SANDF officials ? who they \""saw speaking to two African males ? before they all knocked off together\"". According to IPID?s spokesperson, Ndileka Cola, IPID are finished with their investigation into the matter and have sent recommendations to the JMPD, who has acknowledged receipt of it.

ANCs Deliberate Negligence Kills Again! 4 Men Die Unblocking Sewage Pipe ANC Was Meant to Fix for 15 Years!,"CORRUPTION KILLS: Four local Koster men have died while trying to unblock a blocked sewage drain which local residents have been complaining about since 2005! Nobody knows why the Kgetlengrivier Municipality even exists or what it is there for, because they don?t render any services, except to take ratepayers money and divert it into their own pockets. Even the rescue had to be done by private citizens as the firemen were unable to! Four men of Koster in North West province are dead because of the local ANC controlled municipality, that just steals and pay themselves fat salaries, but don?t provide any actual services. Connie Cloete (61) and Chris Pretorius (73) decided to open a blocked sewage pipe in the town themselves on Friday afternoon. The blockages was causing an unbearable stench in the area and residents have been complaining about this since at least 2005, but the local Kgetlengrivier municipality is beyond useless and local governance has totally collapsed. Chris fixed fridges for a living and Connie was a truck driver. The 2 of them, as well as Lennox Thubeni (56) who worked for Chris and Mpho Melatho, a local gardener, all died after they went into the manhole in Brookstreet, to try and open the blockage and never came out alive again. It is suspected they died as a result of strong sewage gasses. Another resident managed to get the men out, using a gas mask from the local fire department, after the fireman could not do the job. Three of the men were already dead, only Melatho was still alive but he died the same evening in the local hospital. Chris leaves his wife Hilda behind and Connie leaves his wife Annetjie behind. The residents of Koster previously founded the Koster-Derby-Swartruggens trust which will be used to render municipal services because the municipality stopped doing it. The filthy ANC pigs at the trough have more blood on their hands. They forced these men into that manhole like holding a gun against their head, because these men felt they had no other option but try and help their community themselves. ",sa-news,0
"SA Passes 1,000 Covid19 Deaths, But Are They Real? ANCs Old Trick of Deliberately Mis-Classifying Cause of Death Surfaces Again","As South Africa becomes the 22nd worst affected country, only 4 positions below China, overtaking Netherlands and Sweden, who had no lockdown, stories are surfacing of the government deliberately classifying causes of death as Covid19 when they weren?t! However we have seen this old trick before, when the ANC deliberately mis-classified the death of people due to negligence in state hospitals, or from farm murders, in order to skew the real data and hide their incompetence and the silent genocide by deliberate negligence, that is taking place in SA. Are they even keeping track of demographic data in CCP-virus deaths given that it appears to have affected non whites worse in other countries? The evil ANC regime might have been able to get away with silently skewing data on death certificates from hospital negligence and farm murders, but the CCP-virus pandemic has been so visibly hyped up, by its own hand, that it was only a matter of time before the truth of their deliberate subterfuge came out. When Health Minister Mkhize announce yesterday that the mortality rate was 2.1%, far higher than the norm, it was clear the ANC was artificially pushing up the CCP-virus deaths. This would strengthen the ANC governments case to extend the totalitarian lockdown, from its original 3 weeks, and the extra powers and cash that comes with it, not to mention the stated opportunity to \""radically restructure\"" the economy and the laws of the land. The far left antifa propagandised George Floyd campaign has also helped to distract people from what the ANC government is up to, but death certificates, like the death they represent, are permanent and not easy to ignore or hide away. They are a public record of the ANCs evil activities. We all started to wonder didn?t we? We wondered if CCP-virus statistics given each night were even accurate given the global problems with Chinese testing kits, and the 12 day delay in testing samples by the ANC government? We also wondered if the ANC government was not maybe wrongly classifying as many deaths as possible in South Africa as a CCP-virus related death, or exaggerating it, to create and make up fake news statistics, to sustain the extended lockdown, so that the ANC can continue to push other objectives, like to punish especially whites and achieve other long held aims and objections, like grabbing pensions and \""disciplining the private sector\"". SA-News reported that the ANC NEC discussed the proposed change to the pension act to force pension funds to invest in State enterprises and departments, and of course in mega infrastructure projects in which more cadres can benefit, so we don?t have to wonder anymore, because the facts are on the table. The ANC government is indeed pushing false statistics as can be proven in some cases, so just how accurate are their statistics really? Why do they keep on giving the total number of people who contracted the CCP-virus and almost never mentions how many of those people who recovered and are now healthy again? The ANC is clearly trying to hoodwink us here, which is an extremely serious matter, because they have destroyed what is left of the country through this lockdown, and if it?s true that they are indeed pushing fake stats, it is cause for serious concern! Keep in mind that scientists are in agreement that we should have been on lockdown level 1 for a long time already, but the ANC like always think they know better. EVIDENCE OF GOVERNMENT PUSHING FAKE CCP-VIRUS DEATH STATS Rapport newspaper spoke to a family from the Cape Winelands region who says the government insisted on classifying the death of their elderly father as a CCP-virus death, even though he never had the virus. The family said that their father was admitted to a local hospital on 24 May and he died the same day. He was tested for the CCP-virus on the same day and a day later the doctor at the hospital issued a death notice, which is needed to obtain a temporary death certificate at the Department of Home Affairs. The doctor told the family that the health department will treat the man?s death as a CCP-virus death. This was despite the fact that the result of the CCP-virus test was still outstanding! The family says the department of Home Affairs also insisted that the death be classified as a CCP-virus death. The family refused to accept such a death certificate and insisted on waiting for the CCP test results. When the result of the CCP-virus test were received, it was negative. The family says they had to fight with Home Affairs to issue a death certificate indicating the cause of death was natural causes, because the Department of Home Affairs pushed to issue a death certificate indicating death caused by the CCP-virus, without any evidence on their part. The family says their deceased father was in the same hospital 5 weeks ago with a bladder infection and also tested negative for the CCP-virus then. According to guidelines of the World Health Organization, no death may be classified as a CCP-virus death if that person tested negative for the CCP ? virus. If somebody is CCP-virus positive, but died of an unrelated cause like a vehicle accident, the person?s death may not be classified as a CCP-virus death as well. Guidelines of the WHO also says that when a person has CCP-virus symptoms, but also has another sickness, that sickness must also be mentioned on the death certificate. Professor Shabir Madhi, vaccine expert at Wits who also serves on the Minister of Health?s Ministerial Advisory Committee, says that some of the current CCP-virus classified deaths in South Africa are wrongly classified as CCP-virus deaths. Madhi says of the 5 children who were found to have died of the CCP-virus, the death of only 2 children should have been classified as CCP-virus deaths, and even those 2 children had serious comorbidities (presence of another illness at the same time, which might well be the real cause of death). One child whose death was classified as a CCP-virus death was only 2 days old, and was born early without fully functioning lungs. Another child was 2 years old with serious comorbidities. The 2 teenagers whose death were classified as CCP-virus deaths could not have been caused by the CCP-virus because one died in a motor vehicle accident, and one had a scarce illness (comorbidity). Madhi says of the 5 children whose death were classified as a CCP-virus death, the discovery of the CCP-virus was coincidence in 3 of them, and they did not die as a result of the CCP-virus. Even the other 2 children had serious comorbidities. Rapport says neither the Department of Health or Home Affairs reacted on queries about the death of the 85 year old man from the Winelands region, whose death they wanted to classify as CCP-virus related. Keep in mind all of this is subject to the accuracy of the Corona Virus tests in the first place, so we really are on a rudderless ship with a faulty compass! ANC No Masks ",sa-news,0
"ANC Using #Covid19SA to Justify Plans to \""Discipline Private Sector\"", Nationalise Pensions & Plunder Central Bank Reserves in \""Radical Transformation\""!","THE STATE CAPTURE TO END ALL CAPTURES: True to their word, the ANC?s Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma (NDZ) are using the extended CCP-virus lockdown, as a cover to propose changes to the Pension law in order to grab pensions for massive redistribution of wealth, and tender fraud on a scale never seen before! Né Cyril? We should have known. The ANC is coming for your pensions with it?s promised radical transformation, turning the country into a fully communist, totalitarian and fascist black supremacist hellhole. In short they are throwing more wood under the pot in which they are slowly boiling the white minority frogs. Lots and lots of wood. A new concept document by the ANC?s head of economic transformation, Enoch Godongwana, states that the ANC wants to use pension money and the reserves of the Reserve Bank, to build a so called \""open economy\"" post CCP-virus pandemic. Open for looting yes! The concept document was submitted to the ANC?s national executive committee last month. This concept document comes amidst predictions that the SA economy can shrink as much as 10% this year. Ramaphosa also made a call last Sunday at the South African National Editor?s Forum (SANEF), that the CCP-virus crisis be used to \""transform\"" South Africa?s \""colonial and racist\"" economy in his words ? clear minority bashing ? despite already existing and overwhelming BBBEE legislation to cut whites out from the economic sector both in the State and private sector. It is just Radical Economic Transformation (RET) talk left, right and centre. In short it means they will steal more. Much much more. Anybody who knows something about the ANC knows that it is primarily a criminal organized crime mafia organization that uses political jargon as a figleaf and disguise for open looting and self enrichment projects for cadres, whilst pretending they are redistributing wealth, but majority blacks have been getting poorer. It?s going to be a nepotistic orgy of looting as massive tenders will no doubt be dished out again ? to cronies who have the right connections of course and understand #TheAfricanWay of \""tsho-tsho\"" (bribes). Godongwana is now proposing that: ? Regulation 28 of the Law on Pension Funds be changed to use private funds to finance infrastructure projects (Big projects ensures a big payday for corrupt politicians and cadres). ? The Reserve Bank creates a fund of R 500 Billion to allegedly finance developmental institutions. (Now there is a nice big cookie jar for the ANC?s greedy paws.) ? The Public Investment Commissioner (PIC), which manages over R2 Trillion owned by the Government Employee?s Pension Fund, and only invests in pro ANC companies, to also finance long term plans of so called developmental institutions (an even bigger cookie jar). ? The Central Energy Fund in conjunction with the private sector invest in green energy projects. (Cyril Ramaphosa?s one brother-in-law, Patrice Motsepe, is also a billionaire who has an energy company doing business in the green energy market and his other brother-in-law is Jeff Radebe, the energy minister. President Ramaphosa also told SANEF that the CCP-virus pandemic is giving the ANC a much stronger reason to \""transform\"" the SA economy. Ramaphosa said the building of infrastructure projects will form the basis for the government?s economic recovery plan for which large amounts of money will have to be borrowed (if you want to know what happens when the ANC begins a large infrastructure program, go and look what happened at the still incomplete Medupi and Kusile). It was looting and tsho-tsho in turbo drive. Jessie Duarte, ANC deputy secretary-general, who used to be in the Gupta pockets, said last Thursday after a meeting of ANC Alliance partners that the ANC wants an \""open\"" economy post CCP-virus which will be in \""new hands\"". That is code for opening projects for cronies and take everything that whites have ever worked for, like land and farms, and make BBBEE laws even stricter. Duarte openly said that \"" the same people\"" who were in charge of the economy before 1990 are still in charge of the economy and that the ANC wants to see black people in control of the economy. Duarte makes it sound as if there was never any kind of transformation in the last decades and that of course is a damn lie but as expected the liberal media won?t challenge her on that lie, out of fear of being labeled racist or \""coconuts\"" or having their PIC investment withdrawn. The political groundwork is being laid before the troughs can be filled for the ANC piggies to eat, using the CCP-virus as excuse to justify everything, and if that old excuse is not enough, there is always the George Floyd globalist battle wagon to jump on, or fall back on the default blame apartheid and whites excuse. Any and every narrative that arrives is quickly harnessed and pushed into action to pull the ANC?s gravy train of looting along faster. The ANC must be thanking its lucky stars for so many excuses and crisis?s (opportunities) arriving at the same time to do some proper white minority bashing. For a fascist organization to keep its voters and supporters, they need an enemy (in South Africa?s case its the whites). Solly Mapaila, the deputy secretary- general of the South African Communist party (SACP), said that the CCP-virus, which spread around the world ? because of the SACP?s cousins the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ? has shown that capitalism has failed most people, even though the spread of the virus could have been halted, had the Chinese Communist Party not initially kept the outbreak of the virus a secret. This prevented other countries from taking steps like close their borders. China also allowed millions of Chinese people to leave Wuhan ? where the virus broke out ? and spread the virus around the world that way. Mapaila told the Sunday Times that the CCP ? virus pandemic gives the State the chance to \"" discipline\"" the private sector and dictate the preconditions of the relationship between State and private sector. Mapaila, like Godongwana, wants the Reserve Bank to play a greater role in the economy (well obvious because if the Reserve Bank prints more money, there is more to steal). The plan to use private pensions, especially the GEPF, was first brought to the table before Ramaphosa?s SONA speech this year by an unholy alliance of Cosatu and some business people led by Martin Kinston, executive chairman of Rothschild & Company in South Africa as SA-News have previously reported. BBBEE represents discrimination based on skin colour and the ANC even implemented it in an emergency like the CCP- virus ? where whites were excluded from receiving official State emergency assistance, even food parcels were kept from very poor whites in squatter camps, amidst a long and drawn out hard lockdown, that closed the small businesses that white people depend on for their survival, because they are excluded form the civil service or contracts with it. Despite this anti white racism, Ramaphosa still calls present day South Africa?s economy racist ? as in racist against whites?",sa-news,0
"#WhiteLivesMatterToo Whites Hacked, Stabbed, Raped, Tortured & Murdered by Blacks in SA in Same Week as #GeorgeFloyd Looting! MSM Silent!","DO WHITE LIVES EVEN MATTER ANYMORE? Do facts even matter? In just ONE week in just ONE town, Bethlehem, the following black on white violent crimes were perpetrated: An elderly white couple were violently hacked with a panga in their home! Elderly white women stabbed in her neck in home invasion! 86 Year old white women raped in home invasion! You can be sure, you will NOT find the same crimes with the races reversed! While mainstream media in South Africa never mention the race of victims, yet suddenly they hypocritically are quick to join the George Floyd fake \""anti-racism\"" campaign? Liberal media in South Africa never mentions the race of either the victim or attacker in violent attacks in South Africa. The reader of the crime reports have to figure out the race of the victim or the attacker from the names provided or where it happened, yet the liberal media is quick to support Black Lives Matter campaigns or the fake so called George Floyd \""anti racism\"" campaign inspired by the globalist Alliance. Useful idiot lefties are quick to join these campaigns but say nothing if white people are slaughtered or maimed by black men? Why don?t the liberal media and the Soros captured globalist Alliance say anything when white people are slaughtered and attacked by blacks? Why does the liberal Alliance go bezerk over George Floyd, but says nothing about black-on-white violence in USA or in South Africa? One simple fact debunks all their hype and drama: for every 10,000 blacks arrested for violent crimes in USA, only 3 die. for every 10,000 whites arrested for violent crime, 4 die, this despite blacks being only 13% of the population! Black-on-white violence is regarded as ordinary crime by the liberals but not the other way around. The double standards and hypocrisy is becoming so obvious that it simply has to be called out now. So should you. Fox News crime stats The following happened in the small Free State town called Bethlehem in just one week, the same week as violent riots were instigated over the death of George Floyd in America. There are many many more small towns in South Africa, which is why the murder rate in South Africa is 56 per day, that we know of: ? Kobie Smit (60) and his wife Annie Smit (58) were seriously injured when a black man attacked them with a panga on Thursday at around 18:00 in the neighbourhood Panorama. Kobie was outside in his yard when the man chopped him with the panga, walked past him and also chopped Annie inside the house with the panga. The man fled without taking anything and the couple?s neighbour discovered them and rushed them to hospital. Police are investigating attempted murder charges. ? In a second incident, also on Thursday evening, a black man broke a window of a house where a 60 year old woman and her daughter were watching TV at around 21:15. The man stabbed the older woman in the neck, grabbed a laptop and fled with it through the same window. She fortunately survived the incident. ? Last week an 86 year old woman was attacked and raped, also in town. She heard a window break and was surprised by a black male attacker who detained her with a knife, cut her clothes off with it and then raped her. He stole money and groceries before fleeing. Bethlehem SAPS is investigating all these incidents. In other notable incidents the past week: ? A medical doctor and farmer Roelof Botha was murdered, stabbed with sheep shears on Monday 1 June in Tulbagh, Western Cape. Botha had been out clay pigeon shooting and on his return from the land was overpowered 400 yards from his home, and hacked to death with a panga or sharp instrument. ? Pieter Nel (65) is in critical condition after he was shot twice on his farm in Hartbeespoort on Friday, 5 June. His wife Ann was seriously assaulted. ? An elderly white couple Schalk (63) en Lana (59) Coetzee was also severely assaulted on the farm Libertas outside Reivilo, Northern Cape on Saturday 6 June, 2020. The man is in critical condition. His attackers, 4 black men in their twenties, poured boiling water on his back. The suspects stole and fled in a Nissan X-trail with some other items. Lana was able to get help, and her husband was found in bad shape tied up in the shower. Doctors were called out and victims were taken to Kimberley for medical as well as Trauma support. Farm Attack Lana Coetzee 59 Thanks to the cooperation of Rhino Security & Armed Response, Vryburg Prototeam, South African Police, Reivilo GVE, Crossborder security and the public, all four attackers were arrested within 4 hours. Rhino Security had sent out a BOLO on the National Police groups after receiving the alarm and groups where deployed around the area. Reivilo GVE members also engaged in the operation and momentum was given once Oorgrens Veiligheid Netwerk members began sharing information as the events played out. The Nissan X-Trail the attackers fled with got stuck in the mud so they had to continue on foot towards Dirk Fourie?s feedlot near Schweizer-Reneke. One tried to escape to the township nearby and the other fled into the bushcamp. The other two where arrested in the meantime by SAPS. #FarmAttack 29/5/2020: Wolmaransstad, North West. A security guard was attacked by an unknown number of attackers. He was tied up and his phone and firearm were stolen #FarmAttack 14/5/2020: Bushyvales, KwaZulu-Natal. 2 suspects pretended to buy scrap metal. Female victim approached them & one of the suspects attempted to stab her with a screwdriver. Neighbour noticed commotion and fired shots at the suspects. One suspect found dead in field. #FarmAttack 29/5/2020: Cradock, Eastern Cape. Female victim was attacked by two suspects with a knife. She fought back and managed to retreat to the house and activate the alarm. Attackers fled on foot, no serious injuries reported. #FarmAttack 31/5/2020: Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. Two suspects armed with a knife and a firearm attacked the male victim as he was about to leave the house. A fight ensued and both the male and female victim sustained minor injuries. Suspects fled with cash. #FarmAttack 31/5/2020: Mamogalieskraal, Brits, North West. Farm workers were attacked by an unknown number of attackers. Two workers were seriously assaulted with an iron rod. No further details available. This is how they force whites off farms. One by one? In the Free State a woman leaves her farm after a brutal attack: Amidst the George Floyd incident which was hijacked by Antifa and their Soros backed globalist Alliance partners, and despite Covid19 lockdown, which seems not to affect rioters and looters, brutal farm murders and attacks in South Africa continue unabated. The mainstream media in South Africa ignores it and Cyril Ramaphosa lied in New York claiming that there are no farm murders. He said it doesn?t exist. But it does and for the victims it is very real and they suffer the traumatic after effects until the day they die. Sometimes the occupant of the farm has no option to leave because it simply became too dangerous to continue. With farm prices down, they have to accept a pittance for the farm that they have worked for a lifetime or that has been in the family for centuries. We share such a story: A Free State woman, Wilma Swanepoel (66) who was left for dead in an unused cooling room after she was attacked and stabbed on the farm near Bothaville in March of this year, says she has to leave farming life after 47 years and live in town now as she lives in fear because her attackers got bail. She moved to a house in town this week and says the tears come easily these days as she has to give up her old life. She was stabbed 11 times, straight through to the lungs, on Sunday 22 March 2020 after she was ambushed at the farm gate around 17:45. The 2 attackers took 2 firearms and money from the house and left Swanepoel in the unused cooling room for dead. She was only found in that room 14 hours later when her daughter came looking for her. Swanepoel said she felt she was drowning in her own blood and that she could not move. She sat against the wall the whole night, kept in place by the sticky blood she was losing. A farm worker, Phineas Mototo, helped to load Swanepoel in her daughter?s car but he was later pointed out by other farm workers as being an accomplice in the attack! Mototo showed the Police where the firearms were buried. The 2 other attackers were also arrested by Police. Only one attacker was kept in detention because he has other cases, but Mototo and the third attacker were given bail of a mere R3,000 each. Swanepoel says she feels the State should have opposed bail for the other 2 attackers as well. She is still very traumatized and says the attackers know where she lives. She was in hospital for 8 days and stayed with her daughter since then. She only went to the farm in the company of others since the attack. The world will never know if you don?t share. So go ahead ? share. ANC SAPS Brutality",sa-news,0
"The #GeorgeFloyd Opportunity to Turn USA into a Sh*thole like SA, with Murder, Crime, Corruption, Consumerism & Communism!","The Africanization of America: It is not hard to see that the left wing riots currently blighting USA, are more to do with it being an election year and hopeless Democrat?s last gasp attempt to steal power again, than it is to do with actual sympathy or outrage for George Floyd, a black porn actor, high on a cocktail of illegal drugs resisting arrest, who was accidentally killed by a white cop, with whom he had worked as a bouncer at a local club for a decade. However commies will never let a good crisis go to waste in their aim to turn USA into South Africa, where rampant crime, corruption, murder and bling rule the roost! The left wing and far left wing establishment have been having a torrid few years ever since the democratic victory of BRexit and the surprise (not to us) election of Trump. Indeed the libtards have watched their Liberal World Order crumble in front of them, after they have spent almost a century building up their socialist driven organisations of global governance, like the WHO, UN, Paris Accord and basically every globalist body that Trump has withdrawn from. They have been trying their damnedest to leverage their ownership and control of social & mainstream media as well as big tech and Hollywood, to win back some power, so when an opportunity like Floyd George?s accidental death arises, they turned out in force, from the extreme far left terrorist NGO antifa, to the socialists, elitist celebs in their ivory towers and even the cucked conservatives. All the commie heavy hitters have been out in the past week to try capitalize on the opportunity. All the big tech and social media platforms from Snapchat to 23andMe have exposed their globalist loyalties with pathetically transparent anti Trump statements. The riots have reached such proportions they have even drawn the attention of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, who said that demonstrations that often grew into violent riots, clearly show people have been DRIVEN \""to the boiling point\""? If only these short sighted looting and rampaging Africans in America realised to what extent they were driven and manipulated, but then in South Africa we know all about the africans, leaving a protest march which demands Service Delivery to go vote ANC, again, and then return to the protests! Don?t hold your breath though, africans really struggle with the idea of democracy, and seem to prefer to take make matters into their own usually violent hands. The entire African continent can attest to that. Africans are by nature subsistence and what is or is not in their hands now is more important than what could be in their hands tomorrow. Even traitor in chief, Obama crawled out of his bunker to rally the comrades and brainwash them with sweet words about \""re-imagining policing\"". What he describes sounded a lot like the South African Police force (SAPS), where Justice and Law & Order are simply not in their job descriptions or interests. For communists the police are an extension of the Party and are there to ensure the Party is the supreme ruler, like in Communist China, where the reputation of the Party was put above curbing the CoronaVirus, which led to the global pandemic! South Africa is already well advanced in this process with ANC?s cadre deployment scheme. Has anyone ever asked how many SAPS members are ANC members? If these elitist libtards are so desperate why do they not move to South Africa or Venezuela where all the policies they espouse are implemented to a large degree, but of course their agenda is a hidden one so they do not practice what they preach. George Floyd?s sister has already earned 12 Million dollars on a GoFundMe, his brother is nearing 400,000 dollars on a separate GoFundMe and there are a slew of fundraisers linked to George Floyd?s name. What is really ironic is that according to some authorities, George Floyd protests are safe for Corona Virus, but anti lockdown protests are not! Go Figure, snowflakes living in la la land? if only they knew it was all here in South Africa, they might come down to earth! Yet again, we see multiculturalism failing spectacularly, but like communism, it will not stop them taking someone else?s money and trying it again, time after time, despite 100 Million deaths and counting!

"Racist ANC Hides Behind Globalist \""Anti-Racism\"" Campaign  Traitors & Useful Idiots to Wear Black!","The ANC has seen anther opportunity to hide their racism and corruption by joining the liberal globalists who have jumped on the George Floyd incident to not only try steal the US General Election, but also to try restart their \""Liberal World Order\"", which Trump and many truthers like SA-News worldwide have exposed in the last few years. Let?s be clear, judging someone based purely on the colour of their skin is simply stupid, however that is exactly what the ANC does everyday. If the ANC where genuine about \""anti-racism\"" they would have dropped the race based BBBEE long time ago. This then exposes their hypocrisy and hidden agenda and we have to look behind the scenes, before we start wearing black? The ANC has encouraged its members to wear black on Fridays for the following 3 weeks in what it calls an \""anti racism\"" campaign, that obviously capitalizes on the propagandized George Floyd incident in America. ANC claims it wants to create awareness of all forms of racism, but is BBBEE not a form of racism given that it is race based? Jesse Duarte, deputy secretary-general of the ANC, announced on Thursday that this campaign will be launched on Fridays and she told ANC members to become \""partners\"" in this globalist campaign by wearing black. Duarte announced that the ANC is joining an \""Alliance\"" and that leaders of the \""Alliance\"" will wear black clothes on Fridays. Now it is really getting weirder and weirder. The ANC now wants to campaign against itself after its cadre run Police and Army killed about a dozen black men during lockdown alone. It is jumping on the George Floyd bandwagon created by the international alliance of liberal and globalist forces with the objective of restarting their revolution to create a globalist and elitist liberal world order without countries or borders. Therefore it is significant that the ANC announced they have joined the so called Alliance. People have to see the bigger picture here. As SA-News has been reporting for some time, there is an international alliance of liberal and globalist forces to create a world without independent countries or borders. The One World without borders, aka New World Order, movement is a powerful alliance mainly financed by oligarchs like George Soros and it includes the likes of the American Democratic Party (Clinton & Obama), Antifa, Islamic forces, IMF, World Bank, UN, UNHCR, WHO, Hollywood and various other left wingers and liberals and Big Tech in America like Google and Twitter. The globalists call it a campaign against racism after violent riots started after the accidental death of George Floyd. \""Anti-racism\"" is the most powerful weapon in their arsenal and has been used to destroy many countries already and force them to give up their identity and bow down to the globalist One World Government. Usually the country is destroyed economically and then offered bailouts by the globalist IMF, World Bank, EU Bank or privately owned Central Banks. Attached to these bailouts are strings demanding social change and surrender of sovereignty, hence the new \""Social Compact\"" Ramaphosa mentioned in his lockdown speech. Do not be fooled, \""anti-racism\"" and \""anti-xenophobia\"" will eventually even be used by EU, AU, Ramaphosa & WMC to destroy South Africa itself and blend it into a pan-African \""One World\"" Region over the next few decades, as part of their \""incrementalism\"" (which is why Africa is kept in a perpetual state of Foreign Aid dependency and African whites are kept from forming a regional superpower like RSA was pre 1994). Their aim is what it always was for the last century that they have employed their policy of incrementalism ? the creation of the globalist Liberal World Order without countries or borders. They are clearly opposed to nation states and the sovereignty of countries to control their own borders. They have openly admitted that \""there will be no homogeneous population allowed anywhere in the world\""! They certainly don?t want any countries with a white majority anymore to challenge their globalist supremacy (like RSA pre 1994). This is the crux of the matter. The USA was appointed the globalist One World Order enforcer in 1945 after Operation Paperclip, which is why only America is allowed to amass a global military, and THIS is why they hate Trump so much and want to remove Donald Trump as President of America at all costs, through the Russian and Ukraine hoaxes and fake impeachment attempt and now the George Floyd campaign! After Trump won the election democratically and opposed the globalist world view, they lost their main weapon in their war for World Supremacy and global domination. Trump has done the exact opposite and put his nation state, America First. Peter Sutherland BBC But the ANC itself has 2 BIG problems now. 1. The ANC has its own problem with police brutality with their own twelve George Floyd?s of which the best known is actually Collins Khoza. The security forces controlled by the ANC also began with a brutal repression campaign during the lockdown period, in which they not only killed many black people but locked up almost a quarter of a million South Africans of all races over trivialities. The ANC even banned a private NGO from distributing sandwiches to the hungry. 2. The ANC is racist. Very racist. Structurally and Institutionally racist. It has assistance schemes for small business people whose businesses are forced to close during the lockdown period and therefore can?t get an income, but it excludes white people from these funds on the basis of skin colour, in the time of a pandemic that knows no skin colour. The ANC has even defended this position in the High Court and Constitutional Court in cases brought by the Solidarity Movement and the DA political party. Why would this matter so much to the ANC? How many \""Useful Idiot\"" lefties will now ignorantly join the bandwagon and wear black on Fridays? Meanwhile TLU SA has announced on Thursday that it alone recorded over 5,000 farm attacks and over 2,000 farm murders on farmers since 1990. These statistics released by TLU SA pertain to those farmers that are members of their organisation and only represents incidents reported to TLU SA and not all farmers in the country, they said. These murders include the murder of many white children by black attackers and most of these attacks went hand in hand with extreme violence, rape and outright torture. The ANC drenched in blood and racism, having looted South Africa dry, has no cards left to play and has jumped onto the George Floyd incident and the CCP-virus pandemic, not only to remain relevant and hide their crimes, but to complete its own communist totalitarian objectives. Boiling the white minority frogs in the pot. That is why Ramaphosa and his \""prime minister\"" Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma has said the ANC will use the opportunity afforded by the Corona Virus pandemic to \""restructure\"" the economy. That is why it is dragging out the lockdown even though scientists have said we should have been on lockdown level one already. The ANC needs more time to complete its own revolution at a time the globalist liberals restarted theirs? Ramaphosa AU ",sa-news,0
The 3 Types of Frogs That Ramaphosa & ANC are Slowly Boiling in the Pot  Which One Are You?,"According to Ramaphosa?s own infamous admission, the ANC is boiling you in the slow cooking pot so that you do not notice the decline in your rights, freedoms and living conditions. While Ramaphosa mentioned it years ago, it is based on the communist policy of \""incrementalism\"" in which they have been slowly building up their liberal one world governance organisation (globalism) over an entire century! We analyse the 3 types of \""frogs\"" in the South African scenario. Cyril Ramaphosa on occasion compared white people to frogs in a slow boiling pot of water, where the temperature is slowly increased to prevent whites from realizing that they will lose everything, and to prevent them from fighting or fleeing to get out of the pot. We can divide the current generation of all minorities in South Africa into 3 categories and for the sake of argument, we will compare them with 3 types of frogs: 1. THE FROG THAT DOES NOT KNOW, HEAR, SEE OR TALK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING: These frogs are also referred to as ostriches with their head in the sand, and live comfortably, still somewhat privileged oblivious lives and obviously they totally forgot that they are minority frogs, due to the constant anti-racism propaganda on mainstream media. which causes them to think they are in the same situation as the majority blacks, which they are not, even if they vehemently claim they are ? many an arrogant liberal has lost their lives due to this ignorance. They are also usually trapped in a social circle, circumstance or career that demands they comply and deny reality, or be ejected. They have totally lost their sense of identity and history of their forefathers and mothers. They are still swimming around comfortably in the pot totally unaware the temperature in the pot is building up slowly, now more than ever. A good example is progressing from NDP to RET. 2. THE FROG BREAKING OUT IN SWEAT: These are the frogs who know they are minority frogs, they know the temperature is getting hotter but they don?t know what to do or are unwillingly to forego the perceived security of the warming water, because it is familiar. So they swim around in circles, alternating between deliberate ignorance to avoid stressing themselves, and occasionally panicking. 3. THE FROG WHO GOT OUT, TRYING TO WARN THE OTHER TWO TYPES OF FROGS TO GET OUT: These frogs are the ones who know who and what they are and they decided to get out of the cooking pot. They know the water will get so hot that it will be too hot to get out in a very short time. These are the wise ones who know that they should get out now while they still can take everything with them, even if it is at a slight loss, as opposed to having to flee with only the shirt on their backs in the future once the water boils over. GETTING OUT OF THE POT. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? Once again there are 3 options for this: Option 1 ? Make the fundamental mental shift. Follow the news and other alternative sources, question mainstream media and read up about the history of your own people (not mainstream), make your own conclusion and decide to get out of the pot. Even if it is just in your head for now. How many people do you know who do not want to know what is happening? Sticking their heads into the sand like ostriches? Option 2 ? Swap your apathy for eagerness and activism. It?s important to become part of an organization or institution which fights for your interests and rights and helps you to become self sufficient. Remember in a world where the odds are stacked against the minority, organization is needed to help get your point of view across. This can only be done collectively. No people has ever saved themselves without organization. Just think how the Jews of Israel created the State of Israel. They came from all across the world to begin a country and that did not happen without organization. Ot the Polish who had to wait 100 years to get their country back, despite having the oldest constitution in Europe. Support people and businesses believing in the same things as you do. Buy from each other instead of BBBEE businesses. Option 3 ? Move to where you are safe. Get safety in numbers. Go and live amongst your own people and get a concentration of your own people around you. Put facts on the ground. Establish anchor towns. Know that the State will do nothing for you and that the State will seek to take away what you still have. Know that we will have to provide our own institutions and services outside the State, like education or home schooling. Know that this can only be done collectively and with organization. The time has passed where we can either vote or shoot ourselves out of trouble but we can?t lose hope. We can?t lose hope for the sake of our children and our forefathers. It is time to get new insights and make new plans. We have to realize that multiculturalism and liberalism will kill us, literally keep on killing us, and will keep on driving an economic murder program against us. The same people who propagate globalism, multiculturalism and liberalism hate us and self determination ? with a passion. It is time to get out of the pot and look for a new dam. And build that dam ourselves if we have to. Adapted from an article by Marike Labuschagne who works for AfriForum Youth. ",sa-news,0

According to social media posts, the cars were a Lamborghini, a Jeep (allegedly from David Makhura) and 3 Porsches ? all 2020 models! A photo of the five cars on social media was signed \""Money Heist Season 5\"" and signed @HamiltonNdlovu This is just one of many stories of blatant corruption, plunder, theft and bribery going on in the ANC ranks as the Covid19 crisis continues to bless ANC cadres with money and totalitarian powers. One wonders whether the ANC regime will investigate these cases of extreme price inflation? Watch video here if it does not load abouve: https://youtu.be/30bCDDuWLbg Facemasks which can be bought in bulk at R6.50 are sold for R25.00! Thermometers which cost R750 are sold to the ANC government for R2,527.50. Face shields which cost R24 are sold for R108 Many companies that were awarded tenders cannot even deliver the PPEs! Obviously the multinational corporates and dealerships selling all this luxury, fed by this blatant corruption will not complain either? they love ANC corruption! There is no doubt that, ANC blacks at least, love colonialism? #WinterCometh PPE Price inflation ",sa-news,0
New Drink Driving Levels Will be ZERO if Control Freaks Bheki Cele & Fikile Mbalulas Draft Law Gets Passed!,"Thanks to Covid19, and support from the unpopular police chief Bheki Cele, Transport minister Fikile Mbalula?s promise to totally ban drink driving in January, came a step closer to becoming Law with the publishing of the The National Road Traffic Amendment Bill on Monday, which was approved by Cabinet in draft form in March. The new law would drop the permissible blood alcohol level for anyone driving a motor vehicle to zero. The draft bill which had broad support when it was approved by Cabinet in March, unsurprisingly has the support of police chief Bheki Cele, who has already upset many with his draconian prohibition on alcohol and tobacco during the lockdown. The new law which takes an extreme line on drink driving levels is touted to help make law enforcement easier. If that means just throw anyone who smells of liquor or has been anywhere near a drink in the last few hours in jail, then it seems their job will indeed be easier, and the bribes bigger and more plentiful. The amended law leaves the penalties for drink driving unchanged, but removes any mention of a blood alcohol limit, effectively meaning full criminal penalties for people caught with any discernible level of alcohol in their systems. Despite delays caused by Covid19, the draft law which was released on Monday, effectively seeks to allow only people with no alcohol allowed to be detected in their blood or on their breath, to operate motor vehicles. The current law states the permitted level of alcohol for drivers is less than 0.05 grams per 100 ml, or for professional drivers less than 0.02 mg per 100 ml, when measured in a blood sample. When using the breathalyser, the level is 0.24 mg per 1,000 ml, and for professional drivers, 0.10 mg per 1,000 ml. The scrapping of the level effectively introduces \""a total prohibition for the use and consumption of alcohol by all motor vehicle operators on South Africa?s public roads\"" according to the Bill?s explanatory memorandum.

Stories of White Exclusion by Black SA Government! Yet Only 11% of Total Applications for CCP-Virus SMME Assistance Scheme Approved!,"The Black South African government, which defended its right to exclude whites from Covid19 emergency assistance in the Constitutional Court, (and won!), seems to not really care about its own people either! The ANC government has approved only 11% of applications for COVID-19 relief funding for small, medium, and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs), according to the Department?s Progress Report on COVID-19 SMME Relief Funding, while a survey shows 68% of applications for funding were denied. Despite promises of R 2 Billion in Emergency Funding, the ANC government has received 12,982 applications for SMME emergency funding, while only 1,501 (11%) have been approved according to the Rapport newspaper. Furthermore, according to a survey of 2,280 small business owners conducted by entrepreneur education platform Heavy Chef, 68% of respondents? applications for relief funding were denied. Ramaphosa announced on 22 April that the R 2 Billion would be made available for its CCP ? virus emergency funding for SMME?s, however he did not announce it publicly, but the ANC?s policy to only help black people soon emerged. The government even defended its position to only give assistance to black owners of small businesses both in the High Court and Constitutional Court, after the Solidarity trade union and Afriforum took the government to court, over their policy of racial discrimination during a pandemic which affects people irrespective of race. Willie Stols, who owns 2 small businesses in Worcester, told Rapport that he applied for 7 different assistance schemes, including the Rupert and Oppenheimer private initiatives, for emergency assistance after the ANC?s hard lockdown forced all businesses to close, but without any success. Out of desperation, Stols asked other SMME?s who also did not get any assistance from the government or private sector to contact him on Facebook. Within 6 hours more than 100 other SMME?s contacted him, saying they had the same problem. Stols drew up a list of 117 such SMME?s in the Western Cape and Southern Cape region, employing 1,278 people. Stols says he is now forced to make a loan at his bank at the age of 57 because that is all lifeline available to him now. He lost R300,000 in income the past 2 months and he does not have any operating capital left. Chris?s story is of course the story of hundreds of thousands of white people in South Africa. It seems unfathomable that the ANC would continue to wreak such economic havoc for so long before allowing South Africa to move to level 3 of lockdown on Monday 1 June. Many SMME?s will still be forced to continue being closed, for instance hairdressers and beauticians, during Level 3 of lockdown. Anne-Lize de Beer, owner of Col?Cacchio pizzeria in Stellenbosch, has the exact same story. She too was forced to apply for a R450,000 loan at the bank to have enough operating capital for the next few months. She also applied at every assistance scheme, both private and at the Department of Small Business Development, but without any luck. While restaurants could re-open for take-aways on 8 May, De Beer only made a fraction of her previous income. It should be born in mind that SMME?s that can?t do any business can?t pay any salaries to workers, many of them black and coloured. Karen van Blerck, the owner of SC Laundry Solutions in George , told Rapport that it is not worthwhile for her to re-open because her clients are guest houses and hotels which are still forced to be closed during level 3 lockdown. The anxiety of millions of small business owners and their workers is unimaginable whilst the ANC callously plays its totalitarian power games with lockdown and draconian regulation, attempting to turn as many honest people in South Africa into welfare dependent slaves or into criminals. Bheki Cele, minister of Police, has recently announced that 230,000 people had been arrested so far in South Africa for breaches of the government?s myriad draconian lockdown regulations, which will leave all these people with a criminal record should they be hoodwinked into paying an admission of guilt fine.",sa-news,0
Time to Rename South Africa to Azania or Mzansi or Sh*thole? The Republic Forgets its Own Birthday as Not a Single Official Recognises SA Republic Day in 2020!,"Only 59 years ago on this day 31st May, 1961, the Union of South Africa became an independent Republic as it withdrew from the British Commonwealth, however in 1994 ANC unilaterally removed the practice of celebrating the birth of the Republic every May 31st. While most people did not even notice this dictatorial act, it really begs the question, what is SA now if not a Republic and why is South Africa still even called a Republic? Given the ANC?s naked hatred of minorities and constant demonisation of the country?s past, why is the country still called The Republic of South Africa? Is \""South Africa\"" not a colonial term? SA-News proposes it is high time the abomination at the Southern tip of Africa be renamed! Today, 31st May 2020 the ANC regime and its obedient establishment did everything it could to hide and disguise the memory of Republic Day by pushing \""National Day of Prayer\"" and \""No Tobacco Day\"" instead! The national Day of Prayer was supposedly to call upon all \""South Africans\"" to turn their thoughts to all who have been affected by the #COVID19 19 pandemic, even though the ANC has done everything it can to profit from and make the impact of the virus worse. Unfortunately the \""Establishment\"" are fully obedient to the genocidal ANC: The National Day of Prayer was celebrated at St Michael?s Catholic Church in Cape Town after the Roman Catholic Church accepted the government?s explanation that they be required as an essential service. The church said it is planning to draft a plan of action to enforce the social distancing rules to comply with the government requirements. SABC invited Father Sifiso Mpanza onto its propaganda platform but failed to mention Republic Day? The Rhema Bible Church?s Pastor Ray McCauley delivered his message for National Day of Prayer on the SABC propaganda platform, but also failed te mention Republic Day? The Jewish faith also obeyed the call to a National Day of Prayer with SABC inviting Chief Rabbi Warren Goldstein who also, predictably, failed to mention Republic Day? Excluding a portion of \""South Africa?s\"" population is nothing new to the genocidal ANC: The official state motto on the Coat of Arms of \""South Africa\"" is: !ke e: /xarra //ke, written in the Khoisan language of the /Xam people, literally meaning diverse people unite ? however Khoisan is not an official language and the genocidal ANC have done everything they can to deny the Khoisan people \""First Nation\"" status. The ANC has also done everything it can to destroy diversity and all nations and ethnicites in South Africa and blend and racemix them into one as per the globalist Prime Directive. This is typical ANC hypocrisy because even the shape of the shield, which makes reference to the drum, contains two human figures from Khoisan rock art. The official description of the Coat of Arms includes the phrase \""The Khoisan, the oldest known inhabitants of our land and most probably of the Earth, testify to our common humanity and heritage as South Africans and as humanity in general\"". Of course we should not expect the black supremacist ANC to actually enact those words? Furthermore, Batho Pele is a Sesotho phrase meaning \""People First\"" and ANC claims \""Batho Pele is about eliminating wasteful and expensive internal systems that were not designed to put the needs of the people first. The \""Batho Pele\"" values and principles allegedly underpin the country?s Coat of Arms. It is also allegedly about making sure that the Public Service?s financial planning is in line with the public?s needs and priorities, committing the public service to serve all the people of South Africa. If that is not the biggest joke of the century, then what is? Maybe continuing to call the abomination that is the rainbow nation, \""South Africa\"" is an even bigger joke! According to Wikipedia, the South African Republic was an independent and internationally recognised State located in what is now South Africa, from 1852 to 1902. The Republic defeated the British Empire in what is often referred to as the First Boer War, and remained independent until the end of the Second Boer War on 31 May 1902, when it was forced to surrender to the British, after Lord Kitchener authorised the use of a scorched earth policy and concentration camps to hold captured Boer women and children. More than 34,000 of these civilians died as result. After the war the territory of the ZAR became the Transvaal Colony. During World War I, there was an attempt at resurrecting the republic in the Maritz rebellion. The land area that was once the ZAR now comprises all or most of the provinces of Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and North West in the northeastern portion of modern-day Republic of South Africa. Sunday May 31st was also \""World No Tobacco Day\"". The global call to action by the World Health Organisation this year is focussed on protecting young people. Of course, it is also marked by COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in South Africa. Dr. Derek Yach, the President of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, is a global health expert and anti-smoking advocate for more than 30 years. He was also invited onto the SABC platform to share more on the challenges for organisations to encourage people to quit smoking. Once again, no mention of Republic Day. SA-News is firmly of the opinion that it is high time \""South Africa\"" be renamed as it is now so disconnected from its history and all its people, that it has become deliberately, structurally and institutionally genocidal! We encourage people to use the names Azania or Mzansi when referring to the sh*thole the previously first world country called \""The Republic South Africa\"" has become? Don V ",sa-news,0
"12 Day Delay in ANC Government Covid19 Tests! Despite 3 Months Warning & Totalitarian Powers Plus Billions at its Disposal, ANC Totally Failing Fight Against CCP-Virus!","The much vaunted ANC government Covid-19 testing capacity has crashed, as an enormous backlog in CCP-virus tests has developed at the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), resulting in a waiting period of between 10-12 days for a test to be concluded, which makes testing pointless, as the genetic material of the virus breaks down after 72 hours! In contrast, private laboratories, which do just over half the CCP-virus tests in the country, just take a day to complete such a test. The long waiting period from the National Labs is wreaking havoc and threatens to totally derail the fight against the CCP-virus pandemic and render the massive sacrifices South Africans were forced to make, during the drawn out and over regulated lockdown, worthless, driving many people into bankruptcy and hunger unnecessarily. According to the Rapport newspaper a nursing expert says that if a patient in a hospital can?t be tested speedily, the patient has to be treated as if CCP-virus positive, and taken up in a CCP-virus ward. These CCP wards are gobbling up PPE?s (Personal Protective Equipment) at a tremendous rate. The amount of health workers testing positive for the CCP-virus are shooting up which is why it is very important to keep CCP-virus patients together so that they come in contact with less health staff. A doctor who works in a government hospital in Gauteng says the testing backlog creates a big problem because health staff are supposed to stay in isolation until their test results become known. This is not being implemented in practice because of a shortage of health staff. Shockingly, days in isolation are also deducted from the sick and vacation leave of the health staff. The NHLS is only reporting around 60,000 CCP-virus test results per week currently but they have a backlog of over 83,000 cases, says Dr Kamy Chetty, head of the NHLS. A Gauteng specialist told Rapport the genetic material of the virus breaks down after 72 hours, making lab tests even more inaccurate. The provinces with the biggest backlog in reporting CCP-virus tests are Gauteng (24,000), KZN (22,000), Eastern Cape (21,000) and Western Cape (15,000). Western Cape accounts for 64% of positive CCP-virus cases in the country. Chetty says the testing bottleneck began in the last few weeks after their ability could not keep up with increasing testing demands any longer. Chetty makes the claim that their ability is being constrained by a worldwide shortage in test kits, logistical challenges like cancellation of flights and public holidays. However one then wonders why the private sector can keep up so easily coping with the same number of tests? Why have the stubborn ANC not enlisted the private sector to help? Testing capability in the private sector is better because they have a wider variety of testing machines resulting in a bigger pool of test kits available on the market. Clearly better planning ability on their part and as a result they can outperform State capability. The NHLS has ordered 22 other testing machines from overseas. Testing machines whether manufactured in South Africa or overseas must be certified by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases. Keep in mind that the ANC?s aim with the National Health Insurance (NHI) is to basically nationalise all private health providers into one gigantic government health network so that they can have more central command control. It is ironic then that the inefficiencies of central government control is being exposed whilst Nkosazana \""Dr Twak\"" Zuma (NDZ) and fellow communist hacks in the ANC have sought to exploit this CCP-virus pandemic to implement more communist central command controls, openly stating that the crisis should not be wasted, and that the ANC government must exploit the crisis to \""restructure\"" the economy ? or advance the so called RET agenda ? which is code for cronies from the Zuma camp getting more tenders.

"VIDEO: High Court Judge Denies Lifeline to Hair Industry Dying From Lockdown, Putting a Million Households at Risk!","The Hair Industry is in a legal battle to be classed as essential during Lockdown, but got a big no on the first round after four hours in High Court! As if in one voice the Hair Industry have been making the statement: \""We are essential\"", but the Western Cape High Court Judge Lee Bozalek seems to think differently. On 27 May 2020, Advocate Carlo Viljoen, acting in a personal and pro bono capacity, stood up in the High Court for the industry. The State opposed the urgent request for the ban on the re-opening of the industry to be lifted. The Court proceedings lasted a gruelling four hours. According to a Court source, one hour alone was spent trying to discredit, not only the case, but also Advocate Viljoen. Judge Lee Bozalek kept on steering the questions and remarks back to the relevance of the case and to COVID-19 related questions. Advocate Viljoen gave a thorough walk through on each of the 53 points he was using to press the merits of the case. Salons are closing down at an alarming rate. An expert economist, Dawie Roodt, says the industry is facing a 40% collapse within the next few weeks. Emphasis was put on the fact that over a million households is dependent on an income from the industry. Can the economy afford 400,000 more people to be unemployed? Watch video here if it does not load above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrwCSFSyOKY Jade Delphine Tome, is vocal in her role to create media awareness of the urgency and importance of having the ban lifted and allowing the industry to return to work. Jade has been acting as media representative and working closely with Advocate Coetzee. \""It is no longer a question of, oh please can we open and do people?s hair.\"" says Jade. The case has however resulted in a tiff between the hair and the beauty industry. Jade explained that the address was made to Court only for the hair industry. Jade believes a precedent could also pave the way for the beauty industry as well, but unfortunately Advocate Viljoen, his wife Yolanda and Jade were verbally attacked from members of the beauty industry. \""This is bigger than a personal vendetta. We are talking about something far more important, which is the livelihood of people needing to work and feed their families\"" says Jade, stressing the fact that everyone should \""pick up the spade and do the work\"" to get the ban lifted. \""? fight it with tooth and nail and fight it out with the judges, not each other\"" she added. On 28 May 2020 the case was dismissed, as it is \""procedurally defective\"". Viljoen explains that he had to make the choice to bring the case against the Minister of Health or the Minister of Corporate Governance. He chose to bring the case against the Minister of Health. The next application will be brought against the Minister of Corporate Governance. Advocate Viljoen further said that Judge Bozalek seemed to have agreed with the merits of the case and that the merits still stand and that \""this was only round one. The war continues.\"" The legal team of Victor Online Consultancy will be filing a new application. This time all sectors of the beauty, hair and personal care industry will be included. \""Let?s stand up, let?s pick up our swords and let the good fight continue.\"" -Advocate Carlo Viljoen- With the majority of the personal care industry standing together and the new, improved application, the industry remains hopeful and positive. \""We ask that our community now unites, and that there be no more divisive actions or efforts to destroy this process, but that we rather stand together collectively, and win our freedom back!\"" said Natalie Hill from HBIS Foundation.

#COVID1984 Pandemic of Fear is More Dangerous Than COVID19 Itself and ANC Government Abuses the Fear to Control and Manipulate Us!,"WILL FEAR CONTROL AND CHANGE WHO YOU ARE? Very few of us know someone who got the CCP-virus, but everyone knows someone affected by the lockdown. As we regularly see on FB, there are many smart alecs and many \""experts\"" on this CCP virus (COVID-19), and too many of us unfortunately prove that the real pandemic has become fear itself. Indeed, the fear pandemic is now a bigger pandemic than the CCP virus itself. Ironically, the greatest comorbidity of patients dying from Covid19 is hypertension (stress and high blood pressure). Let?s calm down and return to the facts and the bigger picture. There is indeed a bigger picture. We are not saying that COVID-19 is not serious, and we agree that we should do what we can to stop its spread, but the worst factor now is fear. The martial law situation. This allows the ANC to do whatever they want, even ban sandwiches for the hungry, arrest people if their little girl accidentally runs onto the beach, or sell hot coffee, where children are dragged away by traffic officers. Fear is what makes people accept it, and report on their own neighbors to call the obnoxious Stasi Police to lock their neighbors up for nothing. It?s fear that makes it happen! We can also now see that the computer models on which the government justified the hard lockdown, were highly exaggerated. They predicted deaths as high as 350,000 due to COVID-19, but it?s never going to get there. Take a look at what experts like Dr. Glenda Gray and Prof. Shabir Madhi said. They say the government is acting unscientifically and other experts in the PANDA group also say that computer models were highly exaggerated, and that 29 times more people will die because of the severe restriction than will eventually die from COVID-19. The harsh response is worse than the original CCP virus disease. Especially since we had to lose our last bit of freedom. Covid19 is only an additional disease to everything else, also not so deadly. Less than 1% of people who get it will die from it. The ANC knows it all, but it has given them the cover to accelerate their communist and revolutionary goals. There are many diseases and causes of death such as cancer, AIDS, murders, car accidents. But only Covid is singled out? Life is all about living and dying. If we cannot live, if we are constantly trembling with fear, then what is the purpose? Isn?t the greatest goal of trying to provide a future for our descendants? If it is not, then we do not care for our children. Again, this is an additional disease and cause of death. There are many others. Cancer. Heart ailments. Diabetes. Car accidents. Yet people do not stop eating meat and sugar, and do not stop driving. Always look at the bigger picture. Millions are going to lose their jobs because of the hard restrictions. How many people would you like to see without work on the street before you feel safe not to get COVID-19? More unemployment means more crime and more of our people will be killed. Experts agree that the spread of a virus will not be prevented by a restriction. It will be with us like the flu until a vaccine can be found. The pandemic of fear created over COVID-19 is incomprehensible when one looks at all the other causes of death. Every year, around 30,000 people die from TB in South Africa. Unfortunately, this pandemic of fear was forced on us by computer model builders who thought they could accurately predict the future. We?re not going to see nearly as many people die as they originally predicted. The ANC soon realized the benefits of the fear pandemic and saw here they had a great chance to pursue other goals. Nkosazana Zuma stated bluntly that they wanted to use the restriction to change the structure of the economy. Always keep perspective and the bigger picture at hand. ",sa-news,0
"SOE Alexkor Goes Bankrupt! ANC Cannot Even Make Profit From Diamond Mining? Yet Again, The \""Permanently Disadvantaged\"" Plunder The Golden Goose to Death!","If ever there was a business that should be a cash cow for the ANC government, diamond mining is it, well, maybe it is, directly into their back pockets! The ongoing weakness and current record low Rand value means record high prices for Alexkor?s diamonds abroad, which come from a vast resource of 90-95% gem-quality diamonds which exists off the west coast of Southern Africa. In fact it is so precious the entire area is off limits to the public, yet still the ANC government manages to make it bankrupt? Alexkor joins the long list of almost every single other SOE going bankrupt, begging the question to be asked, whether this is deliberate? Alexkor?s business is quality diamonds from it?s unique land and mineral resources. The core business of the Alexkor State Owned Enterprise (SOE) is mining of diamonds on land, rivers, beaches and the sea along the north-west coast of South Africa. Alexkor is also involved in allied geology activities as well as residential services, community services, outside engineering services, external transport services, guest houses, fuel station and even an airport. They also manage considerable investment funds, together with the traditional supporting services (information system, human resources, etc.), which all constitute additional non-core business activities. Despite all this, Alexkor management are destined to be responsible for yet another jobs bloodbath at a State Owned Enterprise (SOE), which has been brought about by the incompetent and corrupt ANC, along with the likes of Denel, SA Express, Eskom, PRASA and most other SOEs that are either already bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy. Furious members of Parliament demanded answers from the Minister of the Department of Public Enterprises, Patricia de Lille, saying we need competent management that has oversight and governance and not the same old suspects. However whether these furious parliamentarians would have done any better were they in government, is doubtful? The trade ministers of Public Enterprises have previously directly reported to the Gupta civilians, so parliamentarians wanted to know to what extent Minister De Lille, who is currently embroiled in a border fence scandal, had personally been involved in bringing people to account that were responsible for the looting and ransacking of diamonds mined by Alexkor, and the incompetence by its management which are at the core of the company?s liquidity crisis. The Department of public works actually agreed that some of the culprits have been reported to law enforcement agencies while other cases were referred to the commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture, however we will probably never hear about that again? it really appears as if the ANC is too lazy, or too busy with looting themselves, to bother redistributing the wealth to the permanently disadvantaged, that they are just letting the \""permanently disadvantaged\"" loot for themselves, in so doing killing the goose that lays the golden egg ? #TheAfricanWay ",sa-news,0

#GangsterState ANC Voters Are Traitors for Rewarding Institutional & Structural Corruption & Stealing from the Taxpayer!,"The ANC bandits have literally been allowed to not only steal directly from you the taxpayer, but also to print money, thereby stealing from your children and grandchildren too! However there is only one person who can stop this wholesale plunder, the ANC voter, but there is no indication they ever will as they are distracted with a constant stream of white hatred. ANC voters have time after time rewarded and approved of this blatant theft and fraud, which destroys South Africa?s infrastructure, credibility, international credit rating and ability to serve the citizens. This willful and conscious destruction of SA makes ANC voters traitors to the nation, for their part in its destruction. For example Mafioso Magashule?s forgotten tender of R230 Million JUST TO COUNT asbestos roofs, gives insight to how the Free State was looted, yet Ace Magashule, has now been rewarded by being promoted to Secretary General of the ANC! ANC voters are indeed traitors to their fellow citizens. When ANC cadres steal, they steal on a scale that makes your head spin because they know there is no accountability or punishment. All pretense of reason or dignity has long since gone as they will steal as much as they can, as fast as they can, as often as they can, all in collusion with an organization of thieves, amongst which Ace Magashule might just be the worst. Rapport newspaper reported last Sunday about a ridiculous tender issued in the Free State to count how many houses in the province had asbestos roofs ? just to count them, not repair or put on new roofs. A total amount of R230 Million was paid out in the end, of which only R21, 3 million was actually paid out to the people who allegedly did the actual work, demonstrating how the ANC manipulate tenders. That is fraud by a factor of 10! In case you missed it, this is an unnecessary tender in the first place because the function could have been delegated to well paid ward councillors at no cost because they are already getting salaries. R139 Million of the total amount was even paid out after the Auditor General found the tender was invalid and irregular. No tender process was followed. Pieter-Louis Myburgh wrote a book called Gangster State about this asbestos roof tender fraud and other corruption projects in Magashule?s term as Premier of the Free State, which lasted from 2009-2018. Magashule threatened Myburgh with a civil lawsuit over the book but has never followed through on his threats, probably because he is scared it would uncover even more crimes of his. Myburgh says the money stolen by Magashule and other politicians in this asbestos roof tender is on the same scale as the money stolen in the well known Estina Vrede dairy farm case. One of the tenderpreneurs involved in the asbestos tender, Igo Mpambani, was shot dead in 2017 in Sandton whilst driving his Bentley. Myburgh writes in his book that a spreadsheet was discovered on Mpambani?s computer detailing cost estimates for the asbestos tender. According to the spreadsheet a person with initials \""AM\"" received R 10 Million from the tender, the initials can only refer to Ace Magashule. Myburgh also says leaked e-mails show that Magashule?s private secretary, Moroadi Cholota, requested money from Mpambani on behalf of Magashule in the time the asbestos tender was running. The Public Protector has found in an investigation that the tender was issued without a tender process to a Gauteng firm called Blackhead Consulting and a partner called Diamond Hill trading, obvious shelf companies set up specifically for the tender, proven by the fact that the tender was subcontracted out not once, but twice!. Blackhead first sub-contracted an entity called Mastertrade 232 to do the job at a cost of R44, 2 million after which Mastertrade 232 sub contracted to an entity called ORI Group at a cost of R21, 3 million. They allegedly counted about 36,000 houses in the Free State with asbestos roofs, but whether that was ever done is anybody?s guess. The figure of 36,000 is most likely pure guesswork or plagiarized from the private sector. Leona Kleynhans, DA member of the Free State legislator , told Netwerk24 that after a failed court case and the Auditor General?s corrupt finding, the Free State provincial government paid out R139 to Blackhead and Diamond Hill. The current Bloemfontein mayor, Olly Mlamleli, was the the responsible provincial MEC at the time. THE MBULULA CONNECTION TO MAGASHULE AND HIS INDIAN BUSINESS PARTNERS It is already a known fact that the son of Ace Magashule, Tshepo, was employed by the Guptas and that Magashule had close ties with the Guptas who stole over R 200 Million during the fraudulent Estina dairy farm project. On Monday 25 May, 2020 the private prosecutions unit of Afriforum led by Adv Gerrie Nel wrote a letter to the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, inquiring about the status of the Police investigation into Fikile Mbalula, transport minister, who is also a previous minister of sport. Afriforum laid complaints of money laundering and corruption against Mbalula in August last year. Sedgars Sport, belonging to the Dockrat family of Vereeniging, paid for a vacation for the Mbalula family in Dubai in 2017, it was previously reported. Afriforum laid a complaint with the Public Protector (PP) in connection with this vacation in 2017. The PP did find that Mbalula breached the Constitution and other laws accepting the money from Sedgars and ordered the NPA to investigate if there was money laundering involved in this matter. This was never done and the matter was swept under the carpet as usual. Afriforum also wrote to the Hawks head in April inquiring about the matter. Afriforum says they will keep on monitoring the process. The Dockrats through their company Sedgars regularly received massive tenders from the Free State government when Ace Magashule was the Premier. The investigative journalists amaBhungane reported in April 2019 that \""Sedtrade, a company linked to former Free State premier Ace Magashule, scored nearly R1.47-Billion worth of contracts out of R3.3 Billion allocated to infrastructure projects by the provincial department of police, roads and transport\"". The figure comes from an official spreadsheet amaBhungane obtained under the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA), showing the value of completed and ongoing projects for the 2016/17 financial year, when Magashule was still premier. amaBhungane also reported that \""Sedtrade is linked to the Magashule family via a close corporation called Tsefay Hardware in which scions of the two families, Fayaaz Dockrat and Tshepiso Magashule, share directorships.\"" amaBhungane also reported in 2018 about a R9, 5 million tender to buy soccer regalia for the Soccer World Cup in 2010 facilitated by Ace Magashule himself. The soccer regalia was bought at the Sedgars sports company in Vereeniging through a middleman, Abiel Mokotso, also an ANC official in the Free State, who was duped by Magashule and the Dockrats and left with nothing. It is doubtful that there will ever be a successful Police investigation or prosecution against Magashule or fellow members of his pro Zuma cabal, whilst they still have the power to unseat Pres Cyril Ramaphosa and while ANC voters continue to be distracted by deliberate OTT racebaiting by the gangster ANC criminal enterprise.

"Colonisation 2.0! African Union is European Union in Disguise, but Does Anyone Care, as Long as the Handouts Keeps Flowing?","#AUisNotAfrica! The pan-africanist African Union?s Africa Day celebrations were propagandised with the slogan \""The Africa We Want\"", exposed the EU?s dictatorial, supremacist, centralised, left wing, socialist approach to the re-colonisation of Africa, in order to force it into the NWO. In fact the propaganda video realeased for the 57th anniversary celebrations boasts about how all the Communist Russia instigated and supported \""victories\"" throughout Africa, in the so called liberation struggles, were their (AU) victories? But these genocidal maniacs go further, proclaiming how \""they\"" are pushing onwards to create \""The Africa We Want\"". Who is \""we\"" and who are they? The old Socialist USSR still? The European Union? Globalist Communism? Cuba? The New World Order (NWO)? The Bilderberg Group? Soros? The Deep State? Who said we even want it? One thing is for sure though, it is not Africans? even if the desperate Africans are only too happy to take the bribes and handouts from the globalists, one can now understand why the globalists were happy for Africa to become and remain a poverty stricken sh*thole ? Africans are now so dependent on foreign aid, desperate for handouts, they are happy to accept the assimilation and destruction of their nations, cultures, histories, languages and ethnicities into one pan africanist structure, funded and run by the European Union. Communism 101 ? Problem. Reaction. Solution. Game Over. Look how they got black South Africans to adopt the Freedom Charter, written by a white communist from Europe! Just like we saw how the EU conquered Europe (The EU is NOT Europe), many national leaders were wined and dined, bought, bribed and even blackmailed to get nation states to hand over powers to the EU. The CIA had a black budget of 2 Billion dollars to get national leaders to form the early EU after WWII. Every single European nation was betrayed by its leaders and so will every African nation be betrayed by its leaders, but it will be a lot easier because African leaders do not care about their voters, love being partied and having their egos stroked with bling, and also Africa has been kept simmering like a boiling pot, perpetually on the brink, ready for the harvest at a moments notice? The African/European Union are thus not only at home with despots and dictators like Mugabe, they themselves are conquerors and supremacists. The African Union clearly considers itself part of the socialist communist movement aimed at destroying all 54 nations states in Africa. The ANC?s violent coup and destruction of the 10 self governing nation states in 1992 in SA was just the start. In Africa, genocide is so easy, like naming the ancient remains of a SAN bushmen \""Homo Naledi\"" (a bantu word) and painting its skin darker than it should be. Africans have been made and kept desperate and are thus susceptible to mass brainwashing. Baa Baa Even though the European Union is by far the major funder and advisor of the African Union, its name and logos were nowhere to be seen in all the propaganda on Africa Day, which is in stark contrast to European nations, where they stick their logo to any bridge or building that they can, in order to profess their \""good\"" handouts of European citizens tax dollars back to them. Likewise, just like the EU, the AU is using all the tricks in the book to bribe, usurp, hijack, appropriate, misrepresent, cajole, entice and pretend that they are Africa, in order to trick Africans into giving up their heritage, culture, language, history and ethnicity to a One Nation Africa, and eventually the One World Order, where everyone is the same and there is no diversity, thus putting humanity ever closer to extinction! But if you are a deliberately starved african, all this means nothing to you, and the supremacist NWO planners knew this, which is why they left Africa in a perpetual state of civil war and poverty! Now they can use the hordes of starving Africans to conquer two continents in one go! As refugees to flood Europe and destroy its identity, and as desperate Africans, happy to give up national powers and resources for a bowl of soup and some bling? Cyril, the current Chairperson who gleefully promised a \""new social compact\"" after COVID19, was roped in along with Mbeki and a host of the elites and celebrities that sellout to, and ride on the coat tails of globalism, just like in the European Union and democrats in USA, They are the court jesters of globalism using pan-africanism as a lure to turn you into an economic unit, with no identity. Just one of seven Billion consumers serving the globalists elites, consuming whatever they deem fit to feed you, as long as you don?t think or question?. Using fancy titles like \""Agenda 2063, the continent?s blueprint and masterplan\"" ? but who wrote it? The EU? Couldenhove Kalergi? A plan to transform humans into \""bastardised sub humans\"", like sheep that only exist to consume and breed more consumers. They talk of \""our\"" pan african goals, but once again who is \""our\""? Did they ask us? They certainly did not ask the European nations if they want to be sucked into a globalist socialist power hungry cabal of business elites, which is why they got BRexit, with more to follow. You can be pretty sure the African nations will not be asked either, they will jostled, cajoled and hoodwinked into it and before the generous handouts and bribes from the EU are spent, they will find themselves with no control over their lives, existing only to serve the needs of the globalist slave masters. However, despite many africans being keen to enjoy the promised luxuries and land of milk and honey, which will never transpire, all indications are that the globalists let the pot simmer too long, and too much water has boiled off ? the africans are very hungry and have been promised everything for free. They cannot wait till 2063 for his handout, or rather bribe, to give up their identity and culture. To sell kith, kin and country for a bowl of lentil soup. But who knows, in a few decades when they realise the promises were false ones as usual, and the hungry africans wake up, we might see a BRexit in Africa? Don V",sa-news,0
ANC Regime Blames & Punishes Citizens Because it Cant Cope with CCP-Virus Peak! ANC Used Fantasy Modelling to Scare us into Lockdown & Grab More Powers!,"Cigarettes & Alcohol are tools for Covid Guilt: As the COVID-19 epicentre moves to South America, we now know that the potential risks and impact, once the CCP-virus reaches its peak in South Africa, will not be the 351,000 deaths that ANC modelers claimed, yet despite that, we were still held hostage at home? It is clear the single biggest driver behind the ANC?s draconian reaction, apart from its lust for power and money, is its fear that the virus will expose ANC?s failure and inadequacies. The ANC?s health system was not coping before COVID19, so how on earth could it cope with a pandemic? Already Bloemfontein is running out of burial plots! So the ANC?s default reaction, as far left socialists always do, is distract, delay and destroy, until the original problem, i.e. their failure, is lost in the confusion and they can blame everything and everyone else but themselves. The entire health system, army and police are on COVID19, everything else, that ANC was failing in, has conveniently been set aside. You now have to feel guilty that you are not doing your part to fight CCP virus when you have a cigarette or a drink! Xi would be proud! A short while back a non scientist called Marius Strydom, who writes a column for left wing News24, predicted 100,000 deaths from the CCP-virus this year alone! These kind of figures scare people and makes them willingly accept the vicious black supremacist and communist dictatorship the ANC have implemented on the back of this virus. It even made some people act as informants and call the Police on their neighbours, to report them for trivialities, just like the people in East Germany who spied on their neighbours for the USSR Stasi secret Police. Currently some government advisors are predicting 48,000 CCP-virus deaths this year, however, Prof Shabir Madhi, a prominent vaccine expert at WITS, predicts 25,000 deaths and another group of experts called PANDA says no more than 12,000 will die this year. Indeed it is fairly certain this CCP-virus is NOT so bad as what certain computer modellers predicted it would be. The ANC totally brought this economy to a standstill, based on fantasy computer modelling. Now that the real facts are emerging, why are we not getting back to normality? Did the ANC not steal enough with the emergency tenders? Or do they feel they have not punished white people enough by keeping their businesses closed? Do they want more time to implement their dream of a totalitarian state where it is a crime to even criticise what they are busy doing? Did we give up on life and accepted dictatorship from the ANC because of doom and gloom predictions of CCP-virus deaths by computer models, which turned out to be massively overblown? Or are the ANC still too scared that what is coming will expose their inability to cope in a crisis? The predicting of the computer model builders is not exact science and it almost never comes true and even the US modelers got it wrong. A group of computer model predictors at the University of Stellenbosch called SACEMA predicted a CCP-virus death rate of 351,000 at the outbreak of the CCP-virus in South Africa! Now that clearly, when one looks at UK and Italy with similar population sizes, is fantasy. Keep in mind SA only had about 6,000 ICU beds at the start of this! As more real evidence, not predictions, emerges, it makes it clear why the ANC over reacted so wildly. They got very scared for themselves and had to find a way to distract, delay and destroy. They also saw an opportunity to play dictator and take revenge on minorities. In France the death rate of people contracting the CCP-virus is now 0,7 % and in England it is 0, 9% says the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM) at the University of Oxford. In Iceland, where the most tests for CCP-virus was conducted, the death rate for people who contracted the CCP-virus is less than 0,28%. In Italy, the country with the second oldest population on earth, it is estimated that 9 out of 10 people who died had underlying health conditions. Despite that everyone who died were classified as CCPvirus deaths. On the Diamond Express cruise ship with passengers and crew totalling 3,700 only 14 people died with most of them deep in their seventies. The CEBM says that their estimate of people who will die in Britain from the CCP-virus will actually be lower in the end, between 0,1% and 0,41%, this estimate is due to faulty classifications of deaths and other reasons. As Waldimar Pelser, editor of Rapport newspaper, writes ? we have to be very careful of being so afraid of this CCP-virus, that we neglect to live. We have to be careful to be so scared that we give up our values. Pelser writes that 20,000 people die yearly from flu and lung infection, 34,000 from TB, 25,000 from diabetes, as many as 24,500 from heart conditions and 5,800 in motor vehicle accidents, according to Stats SA. Despite this we don?t worry about coming into contact with TB positive people, we eat fatty braai meat, we send the kids to school, we drive in our cars. In short WE LIVE. The infection rate for HIV Aids amongst blacks is 13%, yet we have not banned blacks from having sex? There are 7.1 Million HIV / AIDS infections in South Africa, yet we have not shut down all inter personal relations for that? (Infection rates amongst whites is 0.3%). Are we really going to allow a situation where we stop living, where we give up on our values, where we allow the government to implement a cruel dictatorship with racist ulterior motives? Let us get back to the truth and sanity. The first thing we must realise is that the dangers of this CCP-virus for the ANC as a governing party were real, so they were deliberately and totally overblown to us. Yes, people will die from it. It will be mostly elderly people and people with underlying health conditions. But then nobody can live forever and people die from many different illnesses and accidents, but thee will always be the likes of the ANC to pounce on other people?s problems and take advantage. Besides, the worse the problem, the bigger the handouts from the West, (like with HIV/AIDS), and the unaccountable cash has already started flowing in? ",sa-news,0
"ANC Knows Better Than Scientists? ANC Ignores CEO of SAMRC Prof. Glenda Gray & Prof. Shabir Madhi, an Infectious Disease Expert at WITS!","The ANC seems determined to manipulate South Africa?s COVID19 response in a way that it can profit and gain maximum benefit from it, totally ignoring scientific advice, which it asks for, simply to appear inclusive, but then in reality just dismisses. After ANC?s Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize unwisely slammed SAMRC CEO, Professor Glenda Gray?s response to the ANC?s lockdown measures, where she labelled the ANC government?s Risk-Adjusted Strategy as \""unscientific\"", yet another Professor has come forward echoing her claim of unscientific practices and giving a hard hitting condemnation and exposure of the draconian lockdown measures and of the so called CCPvirus \""Command Council\"" led by NDZ! Professor Shabir Madhi, who is a professor in vaccine studies at WITS, echoed Dr Gray?s accusation that ANC government?s COVID19 response is unscientific and that the ANC are ignoring the scientific advise they asked for. As SA-News reported, Dr Glenda Gray, Chairman of the South African Medical Research Council, and also a MAC member, wrote in a column on News24, that the ANC government?s lockdown measures were unscientific and insane. She also stated that many of the lockdown regulations are pure thumbsuck. For instance that we can only exercise between 06:00 ? 09:00, can?t buy cigarettes, can buy cold pies but not hot ones, can buy shoes but not ones with open toes etc. Prof Shabir Madhi sat down with journalist Willemien Brummer from Netwerk24, and also condemned the ANC government?s COVID19 response and its unscientific approach to \""flattening the curve\"". He also pointed out that the ANC regime are disregarding advice from its own advisory body of scientists, the Ministerial Advisory Committee (MAC) for which he is Chairman. KEY POINTS OF THE MADHI INTERVIEW: ? No lockdown can possibly stop the spread of the CCP virus. There are asymptomatic people and it is impossible to avoid coming into contact with such asymptomatic people who can still infect others or avoid touching an infected surface and get the CCP virus that way. ? The lockdown will make no difference in the total amount of people who will eventually contract the CCP virus. The lockdown can at most slow the spread initially but because no country can be locked down forever, the CCP virus will eventually spread because it will stick around for at least 2 years until we reach herd immunity, when about 60% of the population will have contracted the CCP virus. ? The government has an approach of what they don?t ask the experts on the MAC, they don?t have to know. The government don?t ask the experts on the MAC about strategic issues, which have tremendous implications for South Africans and the economy where millions of jobs could be lost (and probably will be at the current rate we are going). For instance how long the lockdown should last or the phasing out of it, but the government only consults the MAC about some technical issues like for instance how long a repatriated person should be in quarantine for etc. This means the government makes the important decisions about the lockdown and the rules and regulations associated with them totally on its own. ? Professor Madhi confirms that most decisions taken by the CCP virus \""Command Council\"" led by Nkosazana \""Dr Twak\"" Zuma (NDZ) are unscientific and that most of the draconian regulations taken by the \""Command Council\"" have no effect at all to lower the spread of the CCP virus. Prof Madhi says he has no choice but to speak in the public domain because the government is not listening, and he feels there must be a public panel of scientists which has to make important recommendations, such as about the lockdown and make it public. If the government then deviates from scientific advice at least the public will know about it. ? The MAC was not asked advice about the ban on cigarettes and alcohol, ? The MAC was not asked about the re-opening of schools. If the government wants to disinfect schools, that would be nonsense because the CCP virus cant possibly survive for 7 weeks on its own and schools have been closed for 7 weeks. In short there is no CCP virus in schools currently, therefore no need to disinfect. ? Children will mostly react in an asymptomatic way to the CCP virus or become only slightly sick. Only a few will have to be hospitalised, mostly those with underlying conditions. Madhi says studies show that children can be infected with the CCP virus by adults but it happens very seldom that children will infect adults. Children will seldom be the source of CCP virus infections. That is a good reason to re-open schools. ? The real danger for women and children now is not the CCP virus but the collateral damage caused by the pause in normal care, like vaccinations. Madhi says a recent document from UNICEF says hundreds of thousands of children will die worldwide during this time but it wont be from the CCP virus. It will be from other illnesses. Madhi says some of the collateral damage is lack of food, lack of schooling and missed vaccinations against other illnesses like measles. He says the lockdown has zero value for children. ? Prof Madhi says he did not agree from the beginning with the apocalyptic academic model of between 88,000 ? 351,000 CCP virus related deaths if the government did nothing. The model was drawn up by the Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) at the University of Stellenbosch. This model seems to be the one which triggered the government?s harsh lockdown. Prof Madhi says there will be thousands of deaths and that there will be different CCP virus waves but lockdowns won?t change a thing. The number of deaths won?t be anything near the high number of CCP virus related deaths predicted by people such as the South African Actuarial Society, which predicted 48,000 people will die in 4 months from the CCP virus. Smart measures like sanitising hands and preventing large meetings and gatherings are what is needed, not the blunt current lockdown measures. ? Prof Madhi concluded the interview by quoting George Box who said that all models are wrong but only some will have some value. But if government is going to base policy on models as if it is the absolute trut,h it will be very harmful. Professor Shabir Madhi credentials : ? Vaccine expert.

Racist Black Police Officers Confiscate Food Parcels From White Families as More Incidents of Institutional Racist Abuse of Whites Come to Light in Lockdown SA!,"Police Literally Stealing Food from the Mouths of Children! When racist black South African Police Officers invade the house of a destitute white family, to confiscate their food, one cannot help but think of the forced starvations in USSR like the Holodomor and Lenin?s genocide. After the shocking incidents of abusive treatment of minorities by black Police officers at Ballito and Dwarskersbos, even more shocking incidents have come to light in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, where three racist black Police officers invaded the home of a destitute white family at night and confiscated their food, which had been donated to them shortly before. The food parcel had to be delivered under cover of darkness because the Police don?t allow food donations direct to white people and will arrest people for donating to whites! The hungry grandchildren in the family, 5 and 12 years old, had to watch helplessly as the three black Police officers carried their food away! Just like in East Germany behind the communist Iron Curtain under the USSR, (who funded and supported the ANC regime?s violent takeover of South Africa), there is a female busybody in the neighbourhood according to the victim, possibly being rewarded for snitching to the police and no doubt with a full fridge, who called the Stasi jackboots to come and snatch food from the mouths of the destitute white family who really need it, because the breadwinner in the house works for himself doing odd jobs, and cannot do any contracting work in the lockdown. The 53 year old man told Mobserver that it is difficult enough to be dependent on handouts but his family must eat, and it was very traumatic for him to see how the just delivered food parcel was carried away by the 3 Police officers. They even confiscated some food which was not in the delivered food parcel. The incident happened 2 weeks ago and the man did not want to report it due to fear of repercussions from the racist authorities, but fortunately a local pharmacist heard of the incident and informed the newspaper. The 3 Police members who refused to identify themselves to the man, insisted on knowing if it was whites who delivered the food. Why would it matter to the Police what race the food donors were? They said the delivery of food by private people is illegal and that the ANC controlled local authority is in charge of the distribution of food. All food donations must be taken to a central warehouse according to them, however this is not law and is not constitutional not ethical either. The victim of the food confiscation did go down to the local Police station but he was chased away by the racist belligerent SAPS. His phone was also slapped out of his hand by the policeman because he tried to record the Police?s refusal to help him, the policeman also deleted the video from his phone which is illegal! As a result of this intimidation, the man kept quiet initially because he was scared that he and his family would be victimised further by the Police, and had the pharmacist not told the newspaper we would never have known about the incident and the racist SAPS would have gotten away with it again as they do on so many occasion due to the atmosphere of intimidation and institutional racism. Residents of the area also know about similar incidents of Police taking food donations from white people in the Mineralia area, but these people are too scared to complain due to the anti white attitude of the authorities. Mr Llewellyn Hemmens, Afriforum?s safety co-ordinator for the North region, got involved and assisted the victims. Mr Hemmens then had a conversation with the Middelburg SAPS who confirmed the incident, but claimed the Police members involved came from another Police station. It looks like the SAPS members who confiscated the food parcel from the victims in this case were also involved in other similar incidents and Mr. Hemmens said they will follow up the matter to make sure the incident is not swept under the carpet. However, like in the case of the family in Ballito where Traffic Officers tried to arrest a child, the incidents will be ignored or excused by their superiors due to the institutional and structural racism that exists in South Africa. Abusing whites is not a crime, it is seen as befitting punishment for being white, who are considered guilty and racist by default (the very definition of prejudice). SA-News also reported about the Cradle of Hope centre in Krugersdorp where the lady who distribute food was even prohibited from distributing peanut butter sandwiches. The local Police also parked outside and watched the place, ready to pounce and arrest the lady as soon as one sandwich is given to a hungry person! ",sa-news,0
"Alcohol Retailers Want to Alphabetise Shopping Queues on 1st June, But ANC Government Wants to Squeeze All Drinks Buyers Tightly Together 3 Days a Week in Long Queues!","As any idiot, except the ANC it seems, knows, less shopping days means bigger queues, but the ANC prefers the stick to the carrot, as evidenced by their proposals for grudgingly relaxing their harsh alcohol sales ban. South Africa has probably the toughest Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, which are mostly ignored by the black majority, who use informal and illegal channels and sources to get what they need, while the police and army concentrate on terrorising and clamping down on the minorities. However, on June 1st, some parts of the country are set to move to level 3 of the lockdown, which may permit more liberties, including the limited sale of alcohol in Mzansi, but to avert a feared onslaught of booze buyers, retailers are proposing to treat their customers like children and make them shop in alphabetical order! Despite Bheki Cele?s wishes to keep them closed till after lockdown, alcohol sales are expected to return for those who can?t do without, as from June 1, when the ANC government is set to partially lift its CCPvirus related draconian blanket ban on alcohol and tobacco sales, which was implemented in March. The government draft plan would allow liquor stores to only operate from Monday to Wednesday between 8am and 12pm, but retailers correctly fear that their stores will get swamped, (with even more looting and ransacking), by angry clients experiencing withdrawal and detox. The Liquor Traders Association of South Africa (LTASA), which represents over 14,000 employees, recommended a system based on the surnames of consumers, to maintain and ensure social distancing. They warned that limited working hours \""will inevitably create a pressure-cooker situation where customers will stand in massive queues in the streets, and will boil over into frustration and even possible violence and looting when 12pm arrives and they have not even entered the premises yet,\"" adding that retailers have already reported an increase in break-ins and theft by criminal elements and desperate individuals. \""Many of our member?s stores have suffered significant losses already.\"" The LTASA rolled out its own list of proposals, sharing its ideas on how to make the lifting of the ban less dangerous. The association suggested generously extending opening hours from Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm and on Saturday, the stores would be allowed to operate from 9am to 4pm. This will \""reduce congestion and the potential associated risks to employee and customer safety,\"" as well as give the retailers time to restock, the LTASA argued. LTASA?s proposed new system is based on the first letter of their customer?s surnames. All those whose surname start with any of the letters between A to M, will be able to purchase booze on Mondays and Wednesdays, and alternatively, those whose surnames start with N to Z would be able to purchase on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Shoppers would have to produce their IDs when purchasing between Monday to Thursday and all consumers would be allowed to purchase on a Friday and Saturday, irrespective of surnames. ",sa-news,0
"Go To Lockdown Level 1 Now Say ANC Governments Own Ministerial Advisors, But ANC LOVES The Power & Money Too Much To Listen!","THE CURVE OF MADNESS: The CCP virus has been totally overblown compared to other illnesses, according to the government?s own advisors. Many of the country?s best scientists, including some who serve in the Health Minister Mkhize?s advisory committee, say the lockdown serves no purpose anymore and that the ANC government is not listening to their advice anymore. TB which has largely been sidelined for COVID-19, claimed the lives of 63,000 people in 2018, so the lockdown \""cure\"" will almost certainly be worse than the virus itself they say. Prof. Shabir Madhi, a vaccine expert at the University of the Witwatersrand and member of the Ministerial Advisory Committee (MAC), who was previously head of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICS), says the government is going to kill more people with the lockdown, and its consequences, than COVID-19 will kill. Madhi also says a lockdown can never be a magic bullet because the spread of the CCPvirus can?t be stopped at all. Even the government said that the only thing that a lockdown can do is \""flatten the curve of the spread of the virus\"". Prof. Madhi says the same amount of people will get the virus over the next year or 2 and all the government is doing now is just slowing the spread somewhat, but this can never be kept up. It is therefore also a logical conclusion that a lockdown won?t save any lives either, if the same amount of infections will occur, there will also be the same percentage of people who will die of COVID-19. A lockdown just slows the infection rate, and accompanying deaths, down initially, but in the end most of us will get it, like the flu, and will have to survive it. Professor Madhi also told Rapport that the lockdown is impacting South Africa?s other health challenges like TB. So far during the lockdown there is a 50% decrease in TB tests according to Professor Madhi. This means that people with TB will be diagnosed late which will impact the chances a patient has to recuperate. TB claimed the lives of 63,000 people in 2018, compared to the few hundred people who died from COVID-19 so far in South Africa. This is double the amount of people who died from COVID-19 in Italy, which has a similar population size to SA. As SA-News reported, a recent study by Pandemic Data and Analytics (PANDA), a panel of qualified experts, also concluded that 29 times more people will die as a direct result of the economic meltdown, brought about by the harsh lockdown than what COVID-19 will kill. PANDA has written to President Ramaphosa, now widely regarded as Puppet Ramaphosa because the Zuma faction seems to be in firm control and pulling his strings, asking for an urgent meeting to explain how the harsh lockdown will shorten the life expectancy of millions of South Africans. Dr Glenda Gray, Chairman of the South African Medical Research Council and also a MAC member, has written a column in the liberal ANC mouthpiece News24, in which she calls the government?s lockdown measures unscientific and insane. She writes that the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital in Soweto is seeing child malnutrition for the first time in decades. Dr Glenda Gray has also stated what we all know ? that many of the lockdown regulations are pure thumbsuck. For instance that we can only exercise between 06:00 ? 09:00, can?t buy cigarettes, can buy cold pies but not hot ones, can buy shoes but not ones with open toes etc. Professor Landon Myer, an epidemiologist of the University of Cape Town, has also told Rapport that the lockdown has served its purpose and should be lifted. Yet another MAC member, Professor Marc Mendelson, head of Communicable Diseases and AIDS medicine at Groote Schuur hospital, also says the lockdown measures and phasing out schedule is not led by science. Professor Mendelson also says that the spread of this CCP virus is absolutely inevitable and that up to 60% of the population will contract the CCP virus over the next 2 years. Professor Mendelson says the lockdown should be lowered to level 1 immediately. Even Professor Salim Abdool Karim, head COVID-19 advisor to the ANC government, told Rapport newspaper?s Hanlie Retief 4 weeks ago already that South Africa had achieved all that is possible from the lockdown and he does not know what more can be achieved by it. Dr Ian Sanne, AIDS research head at WITS university, says that about half of the normal amount of people are missing AIDS related appointments and he expects the same for other illnesses such as diabetes and TB. People with these underlying conditions are at bigger risk when contracting COVID-19. The Western Cape government says that 94% of the people who died from COVID-19 had underlying health conditions like diabetes and TB. Now that the experts have spoken, we should carefully analyze the situation and ask what is going on? The facts are clear that this is the most overblown illness in the history of the world. Yes, it is an additional illness which kills a small percentage of the people that it infects. This epidemic was brought about by the Chinese Communist Party?s (CCP) actions because they initially kept the outbreak of the new pandemic a secret, causing a worldwide spread. This is why we should call it the CCP virus. But the CCP virus is certainly not the most serious disease in the world today and we don?t just close the economy because of other sicknesses like malaria and TB? We also don?t close roads because of motor vehicle accidents? The ANC knows all this because their own advisors have told them. So what are the real reasons for the continuation of the harsh lockdown which has closed most businesses? Just think how many emergency tenders are now issued under the COVID-19 excuse. The other reason would be to commit economic murder on the white minority by closing the businesses of whites indefinitely and then refuse them any form of State assistance. They want to drive whites, specifically, into poverty and famine and make whites beggars. An extended lockdown also prevents court processes like the Zondo Commission of Inquiry where many ANC cadres are implicated. ",sa-news,0
"Covid-19 Tenders Are Now Just Plain Fraud, Looting & Cronyism! No Tender Process, Winners Kept Secret & Any Old Excuse to Steal From The Taxpayer Will Do!","The Free State is living up to Ace Magashule?s legacy of gangsterism and has spent R80 Million on fumigating schools, even though the CCPvirus only lives for 3 to 9 days on surfaces, and schools are closed for over 65 days (7 weeks)! So why the need to fumigate? Once again, the CCPvirus is the gift that keeps giving to the ANC regime and its cadres as lockdown is being dragged out, because the comrades have not yet exhausted all the opportunities for taking money out of tenders, which are, according to them, issued to combat the spread of the CCPvirus. These emergency COVID-19 related tenders are being issued without even a tender process being followed, because they say it is an emergency, and the tender winners are being kept secret! It is becoming clear that astronomical amounts are being stolen right now in Cyril Ramaphosa?s own State of Tyranny and Capture as the evidence is starting to drip out. Netwerk24 reported that a whopping R90 Million was spent by the Free State provincial government so far, after a contract was signed last Thursday with the incredible price tag of R80 Million, to fumigate Free State schools despite them being closed for two months. In addition to that, hundreds of thousands of Rands will be spent on the fumigation of state buildings and offices. Andrew Visagie, the spokesperson of the Provincial Treasury department, confirmed to Netwerk24 that the amount of R 90 million was spent so far on emergency CCP virus tenders. The money was paid to 74 providers. and Visagie also said that the amount of R 90 Million is just the beginning and will rise further. Morena Ntsika who is a spokesperson of the Smart Start Up foundation, a group of Free State businessmen, says it is always the same group of people, obviously ANC cronies, who get tenders in the Free State. His group wants to know who are the 74 entities which got tenders, but the Free State government does not want to say who they are. His group now wants to get more clarity through a PAIA application and they also want to find out how much more will be spent. Ernest Mohlahlo who is the acting department head of Public Works in the Free State has tried to defend the emergency CCPvirus spending when contacted by Netwerk24. He said state employees are supposed to start work in level 3 soon and they needed to clean everything before they start. But why on earth would it be necessary to fumigate for the CCPvirus if it only has a maximum life span of 3 ? 9 days on open surfaces and all these offices and schools have been closed for almost 2 months? The Daily Maverick also reported that the Eastern Cape education department has entered into a contract of R160 Million with a subsidiary of Ayo Technologies, which belongs to the infamous Iqbal Surve, an embattled businessman closely linked to the Zuma camp. It is supposedly for online learning services. These are just some examples showing how important corruption money is for the ANC regimes \""business model\"" and its cadres, but there are other reasons why the ANC, being the opportunists they are, are milking this CCP virus. One of the main reasons is definitely to use this opportunity to punish whites collectively, by driving their small businesses into bankruptcy by extending the lockdown and withholding official government assistance from white people on the basis of skin colour, a racist position the ANC even defended in the High Court and won, thereby proving that the courts themselves are compromised defenders of the ANC?s anti white racism position, in the midst of a pandemic that \""knows no colour\"". The ANC is continuing its economic murder program against the white minority, even sending the Police to catch a good Samaritan who makes sandwiches for poor white people, as SA-News reported in Krugersdorp at the Cradle of Hope centre, but liberal governments worldwide are too scared of being called racists to care. Another reason for the extension of the lockdown is that the leader of the so called COVID-19 \""command council\"" Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ) knows that the Zondo commission of inquiry into State Capture, and the Courts don?t hear criminal cases at while under lockdown. As SA-News reported, NDZ?s ex husband, Jacob Zuma, is an accused in a criminal matter before the court and he is also being investigated by the Zondo commission? ",sa-news,0
"Transform or Starve! Racist Minister of Tourism, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane \""Spreading Lies\"" as ConCourt Dismisses One Applicant in Action Against ANCs Racebased Covid-19 Aid!","The embattled minister of Tourism, whose spokesperson infamously claimed struggling whites need to transform more to qualify for emergency COVID-19 aid, has completely misunderstood the Concourt dismissing one applicant and has prematurely claimed victory, even though the court has not yet considered the matter, never mind issue a judgement! As a result the remaining applicant, AfriForum, has accused Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, of spreading lies and fake news by announcing in a media statement that the Constitutional Court had dismissed AfriForum?s application for appeal. According to Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, they are not mentioned as an applicant in the dismissal in the Solidarity case to which Kubayi-Ngubane refers and judgement has also not been directed to AfriForum?s legal team. \""On top of this lie, the Minister also falsely pretends that the ConCourt?s ruling in Solidarity?s case confirms that there is no merit to AfriForum and Solidarity?s cases, while the ConCourt simply indicated that it will not at this stage consider Solidarity?s application. No ruling was made on the merits of the case,\"" Kriel added. \""If a Minister such as Kubayi-Ngubane is prepared to discriminate on the basis of race even in this time of crisis against people who are fighting for survival, it is probably not surprising that she is prepared to spread lies without batting an eyelid,\"" Kriel said. The Constitutional Court dismissed Solidarity?s application to appeal directly to this court. The application followed a ruling by the North Gauteng High Court that the use of race as criterion to determine who may receive aid during the Covid-19 crisis was justified, however, the court has not yet given a ruling on AfriForum?s application. Should the court also dismiss AfriForum?s application, both parties will then appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. \""It is completely shocking that the Constitutional Court does not on an urgent basis want to hear Solidarity?s application dealing with the transgressions. This matter is about people in extreme need because of a crisis they have not caused in any way whatsoever. Now they have to wait for an insensitive court process on top of that,\"" says Dr Dirk Hermann, Chief Executive of Solidarity. According to Dirk, Solidarity is following a four-step approach in response to the state?s racial ideology. First, they are fighting fully in court, second, they mobilize people to say no, and never accept that it is right. Third, they are encouraging the community to never depend on the state and do more and more things themselves, and help each other. Community power is incredibly strong. Fourthly, their legal team is already reporting the South African government to the United Nations about their racial ideology in a time of crisis. ",sa-news,0
#HungerGames ANC Police Standing Guard to STOP Hungry People Getting Food! SA Government Using Hunger from COVID-19 Lockdown to Enforce its Centrist Totalitarian Regime!,"\""A police vehicle parked in front of the food centre and only left when they saw the centre was NOT distributing food\""! WELCOME TO USSR2: The world must be proud of their multicultural rainbow nation, introduced by nelson mandela! The ANC government is literally preventing hungry people from being fed, in a Ukranian Holodomor style forced starvation policy, as reported by SA-News, in order to assert their Socialist centrist control over the masses, amidst the CoronoVirus pandemic! The ANC is literally using its Stasi police force to take sandwiches out of people?s mouths and is now busy with a deliberate plan to allow people who do not obey, to die of hunger. This ANC regime is a filthy and murderous dictatorship and we should no longer keep quiet about it. Your silence is complicity. Melodie van Brakel from the Cradle of Hope charity in Krugersdorp, told Maroela Media that people coming to her for food are so hungry, which is why she is giving the service out of love, but government rules are becoming more ridiculous by the day. Van Brakel previously cooked food for people and also distributed plain peanut butter sandwiches for about 4 years now. She had to stop both cooking and making sandwiches because of the ANC rules and regulations, for the lockdown instituted by the ANC government. The lockdown regulations ban the preparation of food for others, and Van Brakel also says that a centre like hers has to obtain a new permit for each and every day they distribute food. Something like this can only be described as a deliberate attempt by the ANC to try to make rules and regulations so difficult to comply with, that non governmental organizations have to close their doors and leave people to starve to death. What sort of creepy freaks are these ANC officials? Not satisfied that they have looted the country empty over the last 26 years, while they have been living in opulence surrounded by scores of bodyguards, they have now banned non governmental organizations from giving something as basic as a sandwich to very very poor and desperate people, who have no food in their houses, if they even have a house. cradle of hope sandwichVan Brakel says she had a permit to distribute food for 7 days but now she has to apply every day, and all she wants to do is make food for people. She says she knows she will be arrested by the Police if she gives as much as a sandwich to someone. She says they normally distribute the sandwiches at 12:00 daily and on Wednesday 14 May a police vehicle parked in front of their centre at 11:30. They eventually left when they saw she was NOT distributing food. Imagine a Police force that spends its time to prevent hungry people from getting something to eat. Van Brakel says the government now wants to force them to only give approved food parcels, where their rules and regulations stipulate what may be in the food parcel and what not. The government only wants non perishable food in the food parcels and also prefer it to be delivered to where people stay. Van Brakel says many of the people whom she gives food to are homeless and don?t have facilities to cook raw food. Many of the people who do have a roof over their heads, are so poor that they don?t have electricity. Van Brakel says a tremendous amount of people are very poor and the food they provide is the only food these people will see for the day. Solidarity Movement?s charity \""Helpende Hand\"" has now become involved and will attempt to ensure that Cradle of Hope is allowed to continue distributing food. Hannes Noeth of Helpende Hand said they have already consulted with their legal team. They have already written to the Premier of Gauteng and will also request a meeting with the Gauteng MEC for Social Development Panyaza Lesufi. In order to understand how dangerous and ominous these actions by the ANC are, people should familiarise themselves with what the Holodomor was: The Holodomor in the Ukrainian language means: \""to kill by starvation\"". It was a man-made famine implemented by Joseph Stalin in Soviet Ukraine in 1932 and 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It is also known as the Terror-Famine and Famine-Genocide in Ukraine and sometimes referred to as the Great Famine or the Ukrainian Genocide of 1932?33. (WIKIPEDIA). All historians conclude that many millions of ethnic Ukrainians were killed by starving them to death, because they opposed the Soviet USSR collectivization program, which drove peasant ethnic Ukrainians off their patches of land and into Soviet collective farms. (Sound familiar?) The man made famine occurred mostly in Ukraine which led to the belief amongst historians that the famine was intentionally created to kill off ethnic Ukrainians because they were independently minded. The USSR was mostly Russian dominated. The famine was so intense that widespread cannibalism was reported at the time. The term Holodomor emphasises the famine?s man-made and intentional aspects, such as rejection of aid from outside world, confiscation of all household foodstuffs, and restriction of population movement. (Wikipedia). Just think for a second about what is happening in present day South Africa. Expropriation without compensation, restriction of movement, closing of most businesses owned by white people, and the ANC?s decision to use BBBEE codes to decide which small businesses get COVID-19 assistance and the constant demonisation of white people. And now the news that the ANC wants to ban the distribution of food by private organizations like Solidarity trade union?s welfare arm, which will in effect totally stops food from going to whites. The ANC also appears to want to annex and co-opt the Helpende Hande charity with its adverts on its SABC Afrikaans radio station. IS THE WHITE POPULATION OF SOUTH AFRICA FACING THEIR HOLODOMOR? IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS STARTED? ",sa-news,0
Its Too Early to Tell if Lockdown Saved Lives but ANC & FakeNews24 Run With it Anyway to Justify Their Record Profits and Extreme Powers!,"If there is one thing ALL governments, especially Socialist regimes are good at, it is making you think you owe them something and should be grateful to them. Socialist regimes can only achieve this with complicit mainstream media and yesterday was fear mongering and fake news day over at News24, where they posted two articles that look intentional to hype up fear, before Ramaphosa?s speech, to try to get people to support and be grateful for the ANC and its indefinite lockdown. This should be no surprise as NASPERS, the owners of News24 have made record profits from us being stuck at home using the internet & online entertainment, in SA and in China, where NASPERS are also financially dependent on the Chinese Communist Party?s favour, with more than half of their $130 Billion dollar company valuation based in China! The first article is from an academic from KZN with the totally arbitrary, grabbed from the air claim that the lockdown saved 20,000 lives, a claim that Ramaphosa \""conveniently\"" echoed later in his speech, claiming that without the lockdown, the number of infections would have soared uncontrollably and many thousands more would have died. The truth of the matter is that there might have been less Chinese CCPvirus related deaths, as there would have been without the lockdown measures, but we cant know for sure, and as SA-News reported, one group of professionals estimates there would have been LESS without the lockdown! However any number given by anyone is a guess and it should also be noted that the total number of CCPvirus related deaths won?t be less over the long term. People are now dying at a slower rate partially due to it not being fully winter yet, but the lockdown can?t last forever. The spread of the virus can?t be stopped completely, no matter what draconian measures are taken and the governments own estimates are that it will peak in September, so it is VERY premature to make such grandiose claims. Over a period of the next year or so the same amount of people will die. We are only postponing the inevitable as the CCP virus will be deadly to some but not all, and that is the truth of the matter ? ANC cannot take credit for the majority who it only affects mildly. The other article published on News24 was by a non scientist called Marius Strydom which claims a Corona related death rate of 100,000 people in 3 months time, which is complete and utter nonsense. Where does he get his facts from? And News24 is publishing this? Are they not the ones who are always accusing others of fake news? The ANC said in the beginning they need 3 weeks of lockdown to get hospitals ready. To that we agreed. But then the ANC shifted the goalposts and went into overdrive to create a permanent dictatorship and drive as many people into bankruptcy and unemployment as possible. They also started to discriminate on the basis of race as can be seen in their policy to only assist non whites with government funds. To this we will not agree. We wont bend to this. The communists are also grabbing the chance to implement a central command system as can be seen in Patel?s ridiculous list of clothes which may or may not be bought. To News24 we ask : Who are the fake news now? Look in the mirror? ",sa-news,0
ANC Regime Use Their SABC Propaganda Arm to Trick Afrikaans RSG Listeners into Donating to ANCs Solidarity Fund Which Excludes Whites!,"The ANC are using their propaganda platform, the SABC which broadcasts Radio Sonder Grense (RSG) in Afrikaans, to deceptively and fraudulently solicit funds for their CCPvirus Solidarity fund, using the name of the Solidarity Trade Union who operate a charity called \""Helpende Hand\"". The ANC regime is busy with deliberate deceit and misrepresentation in their Solidarity Fund advertisement on their RSG Radio, where they are trying to get white Afrikaans speaking listeners to part with their money, for the ANC?s very racist Solidarity Fund, using the name of the Solidarity Trade Union for their fund and also including the name of Solidarity Trade Union?s charity, \""Helpende Hand\"" in the advertisement! The ANC are attempting to swindle and deceive people to give money to a government fund, which will allocate funds according to ANC rules. That means that if you are white, you are out. It is bad enough that they call it the Solidarity fund because there is certainly no solidarity shown to poor white people, because the ANC is refusing to give official assistance to white people even though they have closed their businesses in the lockdown period. The ANC government is even going to defend its racist stance in the Constitutional Court, confirming that they will only assist black business people during the COVID-19 lockdown, in a matter brought by the Solidarity Movement trade union. The Solidarity trade union is asking the Constitutional Court to declare the government?s COVID-19 assistance policy illegal, because the government said they will use a BBBEE based system to determine who gets help from government. In practice that means only black people will be helped. There was suspicion from the start that the ANC stole the Solidarity Movement?s (the trade union) name to use for their Solidarity fund, but when they say in their advertisement on RSG radio, which broadcasts nationally in Afrikaans, that you must give a \""Helpende Hand\"", it is clear they are doing it on purpose, because Helpende Hand is the Solidarity trade union and larger movement?s charity. Why would you part with your hard earned money knowing that the government?s Solidarity fund is so racist that they wont even give a food parcel to a poor destitute white person in a squatter camp?

"Are South Africas Clintons, The Zumas, Using Lockdown for Personal & Political Gain, To Save a Disgraced Jacob Zuma from Zondo Commission?","Is SA?s Hillary Clinton, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Who Desperately Wants to be President Too, Using Her Command Council Lockdown Power to Save her ex-Husband & ex-President, SA?s Disgraced Bill Clinton, Jacob Zuma? The remarkable similarities between the Zumas and Clintons are more than deja-vu, they are the hallmark of gross abuse of State structures to satisfy a desperate greed and lust for power. Zuma?s ex-wife who is in charge of the ANC?s CCPvirus \""Command Council\"" which is enforcing unconstitutional powers, could draw out lockdown forever, thereby postponing Zuma?s court case and the Zondo Commission. Emeritus Professor Pieter Labuschagne, a law expert at UNISA, warns that South Africa has entered dangerous territory after the ANC government claimed ultra Constitutional powers for itself, as its response to the Chinese CCP virus pandemic. A side motive of this that is maybe the most obvious one, that has not even been noticed, is Jacob Zuma?s attempt to dodge the law and Zondo commission with his ex wife in charge of the ANC?s illegal mechanism called a command council, used to implement and oversee the lockdown. It also looks like the Zuma faction of the ANC has used this as another less obvious way to regain control and that Cyril is possibly now President in name only, making way for NDZ?s ultimate ambition, to be President, like Hillary? Sometimes things hide in plain sight and by now it must be clear that the ever opportunistic Zumas and ANC have many other motives for the harsh lockdown, like looting opportunities for its cadres, and using the harsh lockdown to drive white people and small businesses into bankruptcy and onto socialist welfare, by keeping their businesses closed indefinitely and denying them taxpayer help. Labuschagne says the government?s CCP virus \""command council\"" has claimed such super status for itself, that the participants of that council, which is of course led by Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Jacob Zuma?s ex wife, regard themselves as above accountability and transparency. Did anyone ever consider that this CCP virus command council will want to draw out the lockdown, because the Courts and Zondo commission of Enquiry into State Capture can?t sit during such a lockdown? Jacob Zuma is an accused in front of both the Court and Zondo commission remember? Labuschagne says article 9 (2) of the Constitution says members of the Cabinet are individually and collectively accountable to Parliament, which is supposed to represent the citizens of the country. At least in theory they are supposed to. Labuschagne says the cabinet has now delegated its authority and powers to a shadowy command council with super status and which is not under supervision of anyone, not even Parliament. This would of course be totally unconstitutional. Labuschagne says the command council even refuses to release its minutes. Even the previous Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, has waded in and written an opinion piece in News24 in which she says the Disaster Management Act does not make provision for the suspension of Parliament?s supervisory role. She also criticized the fact that Parliament does not currently play a supervisory role in the CCP virus command council led by NDZ. There have also been questions raised over reasons for NDZ?s ban on cigarettes and her connection to a self confessed cigarette smuggler, and then there is Edward Zuma, who is Director of ATM Tobacco? and wouldn?t you know, co-incidentally at the same time, Duduzane Zuma starts airing ANC?s dirty laundry, in conversations with his Father on Youtube in Zooming with the Zumas?

Do Not Pay Covid-19 Lockdown Fines Which Could Leave You With a Criminal Record! Criminal Law Expert Explains Your Options.,"Do not get tricked or sucker punched into just paying a COVID-19 \""Admission of Guilt\"" lockdown fine, as it could leave you with a criminal record for something which is unnecessary and unconstitutional! These admission of guilt fines will leave you with a criminal record if paid which will give you big problems in future, like when you apply for a visa, firearm licence or apply for a job even. This is the advice of a criminal law expert of Kempton Park, Mr Riaan Louw. Louw says there are other options for an accused. An accused or a legal representative of an accused can also write to the State prosecutor to state that you did not have the intent to transgress the regulation. Mr Louw says intent will always have to be proven by the State. A trial is something the State will not prefer because then everything will have to be in order from the State?s side, including sworn affidavits from their witnesses and the witnesses will have to pitch up to testify. Louw says of the 20 cases of people arrested for lockdown violations in Kempton Park, 19 cases were withdrawn by the State. Mr Louw also says the State will face a massive bill for civil claims after the lockdown because of the totally frivolous nature of many arrests which are also totally illegal, like the arrest of Liam Bulgen and Tereza Cervinkova in Muizenberg, when their toddler ran onto the beach. Mr Louw says it does not even state in the regulations that you are not allowed on the beach. Police arrested the couple and their toddler baby daughter on Monday 4 May, 2020 during the government?s allowed exercise period in Muizenberg. The incident happened at 08:45 when Liam Bulgen and his fiancee, Tereza Cervinkova were arrested together with their baby girl when they went walking on the pavement next to the beach, something which is allowed. Their big crime for which they were arrested for, came when the little girl ran onto the beach as any child would. Liam immediately followed to go and fetch the girl and it was then that he was swooped upon by the Police and put in the back of a Police van! His partner and baby daughter were also arrested and also taken to the Police station. There they were kept for hours despite the fact that the baby girl is small and needs to be fed. Her mother had to breastfeed her at the station in the end. Liam says his own mother wanted to bring food and a clean nappy for the baby but she was not allowed to get into the Police station. After being kept for several hours in detention, the couple were given a court summons with the option to pay a fine and released. Liam says the Police members who arrested him and the commander at the Police station had no masks on. People who are arrested on these bogus charges should remember that the disaster regulations did not suspend the Constitution as the Police seems to believe happened. Arrested people should not pay the fine as anyone who does pay the fine also makes an admission of guilt at the same time and will have a criminal record afterwards. Everyone should go to court and defend themselves. They should also get legal representation and sue the State for illegal arrest. If someone is abducted by the Police and they are released without criminal charges, it means the Police committed the crime of abduction. Criminal charges should be opened and IPID contacted. They should also sue the Police for a large amount in a civil lawsuit. We should fight for our liberties and rights because if we don?t, the future will hold the same type of abuse as we are currently going through. People should also join a civil rights organization like Afriforum because they offer a support network and opportunity for collective action. The more members a civil rights organization has, the stronger their voice will be when fighting these abuses. People should take note that the lockdown did not suspend any Constitutional right of anyone, and the Police is still required to act legally and rationally. Also. if you?re struggling to pay rent due to a loss of income during lockdown, credit expert Michelle Dickens advises that you ensure that you have documentation proving you?re no longer getting income ? and allow your landlord to contact your employer to confirm your position. She said some options that can be looked at is using your deposit to pay rent (and top it back up later), for renters to work out a rental deferment plan, so you can make up payments once you have an income again.

"Be it the Ramaphosa Faction or The Zuma Faction, it is Still The ANC, Which Whites, Coloureds & Indians Ignore at Their Peril!","Ramaphosa openly says he wants to build a future economy \""for black people in the main\"", yet many white people still want to believe that Ramaphosa is their saviour, even as he turns up the heat on the \""frog boiler\"". Cyril Ramaphosa recently made a speech in Durban where the catchphrases, cliches and misleading buzzwords rolled faster off his tongue than a mandela AK47 machine gun can spray bullets. This speech in KZN is no coincidence as the Zuma faction is growing stronger and making its intentions of ousting Ramaphosa clearer, however, it is still the ANC! Speaking in front if the KZN provincial government?s \""command council\"" on Tuesday, Ramaphosa was quite possibly trying to convince Jacob Zuma?s home province that he is \""the struggle\"" leader when it comes to radicalism, but after this speech white people and the coloured & Indian community should know clearly that the man held out as a hero by some in their communities, does not even see them included in South Africa?s economic future. He even said so, but whites seem to filter out what they do not want to hear. Of course this should have been clear to the minorities since 1993, when Ramaphosa told ex IFP MP Mario Oriani-Ambrosini, about the ANC?s long term \""boil the frog slowly\"" strategy to incrementally, over time, take whatever belongs to white people, including their farms, schools and businesses, because if the ANC moved too fast, it would alarm them and give white people time to mobilise. It is obvious the ANC?s strategy, which is just a local implementation of the tried and tested communist strategy of \""incrementalism\"", has worked perfectly and the \""frog\"" is only now realising that its very difficult to jump out of the currently locked-down South African pot, which has tuned into a fully fledged black dictatorship. There were many voices that called out in the past, including SA-News, we first pointed out the boiling frogs 2 years ago, and warned 5 years ago that South Africa was moving in the direction of another Zimbabwe, but not enough people from the minorities seemed to care and many wrapped themselves in the politically correct liberal flag, ready to attack and vilify anyone opposed to the liberal PC viewpoint. Ramaphosa?s speech was mostly mumbo jumbo packed full with rhetorical catchphrases from the Zuma era narrative, but he revealed himself in one very significant way, and to this the white and coloured communities, and that includes the liberals because their skins are also not black, should pay careful attention, because this involves their very future and the future of their children, if they have any. This came when Ramaphosa said \""the new economic future must be inclusive, empowering to women, young people and to black people in the main\"" ? So what is BBBEE then? Could Ramaphosa have been more clear? Could he have been more revealing? \""BLACK PEOPLE IN THE MAIN\"". That simply means black privilege and that the white, and even the coloured community, is simply not included in the ANC?s plans for the future of South Africa. Ramaphosa also said that \""we are witnessing the \""total destruction\"" of our economy due to the Covid-19 coronavirus (yes correct, but not mainly due to the virus, because most people who get it recover, but because the ANC created a man-made disaster in the despotic way the lockdown has been implemented) and that radical economic transformation must be central to plans to rebuild and repurpose.\"" Some of the other catchphrases mainly dating from the Zuma era narrative that Ramaphosa uttered was: \""Covid-19 had presented an opportunity to \""reconstruct\"" the economy\"" and, \""we must begin to put in place the pillars of a new economy. We cannot continue in the same old way,\"" \""Radical economic transformation must underpin the economic future that we will need to craft going forward. We should be able to do this through a new compact we are going to build,\"" The buzzword \""social compact\"" surfaced a while back when plans by the ANC were revealed to seize about 10% of the pension fund of government workers and plunge that into Eskom. In the socialist ANC jargon, \""compact \"" means that they take and you give. That, to them is a compact. Another piece of codespeak by Ramaphosa was when he said \""playing around on the edges with whatever efforts we are making ? that time is over now.\"" One wonders what the ANC was doing for 26 years \""playing around on the edges\"". What does this mean? Slowly raising the temperature on the boiling frogs? The white community should realise that Ramaphosa is a code speaker and whilst you as a white person might not have an idea about what he is speaking about, like when Malema speaks, it does have meaning to the black masses. They are receiving Ramaphosa?s veiled messages and they see it as a clear indication that the ANC is legalising and speeding up the \""boil the frog\"" strategy. ",sa-news,0
"How China, the #CCPvirus and NASPERS Sent South African Stocks Index to Record Highs in April Despite Lockdown!","The Rich Get Richer: Is it any wonder NASPERS was able to \""donate\"" 1 Billion worth of Chinese made testing kits and PPE to South Africa, after unprecedented demand for online services & entertainment during the Covid-19 lockdowns, firstly in China when the CoronaVirus started, and now in SA, saw a scramble for safe investments, which helped grow NASPERS valuation, and set the South African stocks index on course for a record April month! The benchmark index in Johannesburg is up 14% in April, the most in any month since Bloomberg began tracking the gauge in 1995. Most South Africans do not realise the extent of China?s influence on South Africa even though millions of South Africans have a financial stake in the growing intolerance of criticism by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Government. Chinese multinationals have to operate in a globalised world while being complicit to, used, manipulated and constrained by Chinese Communist government policy, which should be concerning and disappointing if you are a Naspers shareholder or just a South African investor with a heavy weighting of your portfolio in the domestic market, because Naspers totally dominates the Johannesburg stock market. The not so local anymore media group, Naspers owns 31% of China-based Tencent Holdings, which operates the Chinese version of Mxit and Twitter and also operates WeChat, (China?s Facebook,) which has over 1 Billion accounts! Ever since being introduced to Tencent by London Investment Banks, as a way to get capital out of South Africa, NASPER?s Tencent stake has been worth more than Naspers has been worth itself for years now, and dominates the $130 Billion group?s finances, which was one motivation for spinning off Prosus to Amsterdam to narrow that value gap. Many investors buy NASPERS shares as a means to invest in Tencent growth cheaply, so really NASPERS is not what it purports to be, and its value is certainly not reflective of the corporation?s activities or profitability even! The investment return from Tencent currently ranks as one of the most successful in modern times and that shareholder profit has bought NASPERS loyalty from many Afrikaans speaking South Africans, despite being betrayed by the traditionally Afrikaans SA media & tech monopoly on many fronts. Naspers has been the biggest contributor to April?s stock market gains, with the Cape Town based media and tech giant attaining record highs as it benefits from its 31% stake in Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings, which includes WeChat. The unprecedented growth in reliance on the internet and digital services and platforms prompted by the pandemic in China, has boosted Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. Naspers unit Prosus NV, which holds the Tencent stake, has gained 17% in Johannesburg this year. The stake in Tencent, the world?s biggest videogame company and home to the hugely popular WeChat social media platform, is now worth $130 billion and has been singularly the reason for Naspers? rapid growth towards becoming Africa?s most valuable listed company. However, as any unfortunate shareholder in the Russian companies, Yukos or Sistema, or MTN in Nigeria or Acacia Mining in Tanzania may warn you, it is prudent to be very careful of owning stocks in companies in countries with all powerful totalitarian governments, where allegations around judicial independence exist and property rights may not be respected if the Government isn?t a co-shareholder. When an investor buys a stock, they inherently rely on the property rights of the country and the listing requirements of the stock exchanges and the corporate governance of directors to safeguard their investment, and when it comes to China, that picture is pretty murky. NASPERS has had to obey the Chinese Communist Party already by having to hand over client account data of Chinese activists, who subsequently disappeared! Naspers, who was up 14% in April makes up 20% of the main index, with smaller contributions to this month?s records coming from safe haven market heavyweights BHP Group Ltd., Anglo American Plc and Richemont. Sasol, AngloGold Ashanti and Gold Fields are also among leading market drivers as bullion heads for its best month since 2016, thanks to its allure as a store of value during these desperate times. Meanwhile Anglo American Plc plans to exit the South African thermal coal business in the next three years by selling or spinning off the unit as the group accelerates its retreat from the fossil fuel. Anglo had been talking of plans to stop mining coal in the past year, and finally gave more details in a written response to shareholder questions, which provide a clear route to its exit.

"\""A Clean Slate\"" Boasts Ramaphosa? COVID-19 is Corrupt & Inept ANCs Get Out of Jail Free Card, but They are Plundering and Messing That Up Too!","The ANC and black elites act like COVID-19 is the best thing to happen to them since this first world country, then the largest economy in Africa, was just handed to them on a silver platter, like a massive lottery win. The ANC regime are actively using COVID19 to not only cover up all their clumsy failures since then, but also to hide all their crimes over the last 3 decades. However their Covid19 response will be just another big failure for them, and is already rife with crime and corruption! In fact they like it so much Health Minister Mkhize said Covid19 will be with us for another two years and Cyril even joked a few weeks ago that lockdown will last till next year! With almost visible relief, Cyril who has been looking much more relaxed since Corona Virus arrived in SA, said \""COVID19 has brought about a total destruction of our economy\"". How can you destroy an already destroyed economy? Not only did they get a free pass on past wrongs, they now also have an opportunity to enact some very sinister new scams and regulations, and already Cyril has proclaimed \""a new way of doing things after all this\"" that would not have been possible previously ? once again COVID19 is the gift that never stops giving for the ANC regime. The truth is the ANC has only being mimicking what the rest of the world is doing, while it tries to take advantage of the situation, which is why they went into lockdown so soon. However, mistakenly they are trying to come out of it with the rest of the world, while the SA curve is still steeply upward. Their mis-timed actions are proven in the fact that SA is the only country in the world whose infection rate went down from day one of lockdown, even though the incubation period is two weeks! In fact the infection rate went even higher after two weeks of lockdown, so they are way off the mark.SA Test Figures Wrong Truth is the black masses have already made it very clear they would rather contract COVID19 than face hunger, besides Ramaphosa has no way of feeding millions of hungry people and no way of delivering that aid without most of it going missing, especially not to an entire population of 50 million that has been raised on the idea that everything is free, and that simply demanding something somehow justifies your right to it. The South African economy will go into official Depression as the current conditions won?t improve and it certainly was not improving beforehand either. The economy was in a recession already before COVID-19 \""put a spanner in the works ? sending it into a tailspin\"" which is their big convenient excuse. \""A job?s bloodbath is unavoidable\"" they claim with Business for South Africa saying between one and 4 million jobs are at risk, despite level 4 lockdown regulations and the economy opening up. Depression means mass unemployment but the country was already on at least 29% unemployment rate, so an increase to as much as 50% this year because of the impact of the Coronavirus means ANC was doing worse for jobs than Corona is. Businesses across the economic spectrum continue to lay off workers in big numbers as they struggle to survive under lockdown, and Ramaphosa has called on government to \""no longer walk on eggshells, in creating a conducive environment for job creation\"", but if they were not able to do it before, what would make them think they could do it now? Unless there are some new fundamental changes taking place? Already some parties and unions have called for a radical policy shift in the beneficiation (adding value) of raw minerals, but without the white man in the workplace, they will struggle to process raw materials into something marketable and competitive on international markets. This is the one lesson ANC refuses to learn, as long as BBBEE exists they will continue to stumble from crisis to bailout to crisis in a downward spiral, no matter how many get out of jail free cards they get. The COVID-19 crisis has worsened conditions for the already struggling manufacturing sector, even though some have been operational for essential goods throughout. The business activity index of the Absa Purchasing Managers Index crashed to an all-time low in April. Similarly, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) says the sale of new vehicles dropped by 98.4% in April. Like many sectors, the aviation industry worldwide is also taking a knock due to COVID-19 and yesterday, operators of the already embattled Kulula and British Airways? COMAIR, announced that it would go into business rescue and didn?t expect to be back into full operation before October or November this year. The company had already reported a half-year loss of 564 Million rand, so now they get to blame COVID-19 and not their own corruption and ineptitude. Airlines are only expected to resume full domestic operations when level 2 of the national lockdown goes into effect. Despite carriers like SAA being refused bailouts previously, local and international aviation and tourism bodies are now appealing for 10 Billion Dollars from global financial institutions amid concerns that many businesses won?t survive the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet many in SA who were already dying before, are cynically and conveniently tapping into this. The International Air Transport Association, the UN Tourism Organisation, the World Travel, and Tourism Council, the African Airlines Association, and the Airlines Association of Southern Africa say that without urgent bailouts, the COVID-19 crisis could see a collapse of these sectors in Africa, where the majority of operators stumble from bailout to bailout in any event. Maybe it is time they were put out of their misery? Meanwhile the Competition Commission has been hunting down private companies inflating prices for masks and essential goods and have targeted a distributor of face masks and personal protection gear who will pay R11 million \""admission of guilt\"". It?s the only major consent agreement confirmed by the Competition Tribunal which is the body above the Commission, however government agencies are largely exempt from such scrutiny so they get a free pass too and can, and do profiteer as much as they like. R1,200 for a food parcel anyone? South Africa Liquor Brandonwers Association (SALBA) says it is concerned that South Africa remains one of the very few countries in the world that continues to prohibit all sale of alcoholic beverages during National lockdown, but Cyril Ramaphosa has rubbished claims that there is any agenda from government in the draconian banning of tobacco products during the Covid-19 Level 4 and 5 national lockdown. \""No one is trying to pursue any interests. The only interests we are pursuing is the health of our people, finish and klaar,\"" he said on Tuesday whilst incredulously saying \""we live in a free country\""! The prohibition of tobacco sales during lockdown Level 4 will still play out in court even though, in an unexpected move, British American Tobacco South Africa (BATSA) backed down on its legal bid, for some sinister reason. BATSA says following a response from the National Command Council headed by Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma (NDZ), it concluded that it was best to work with the government on the issue. But the Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA) is still set on getting the ban reversed. Wonder if the draconian Command Council which is heavily influenced by the SACP, will get to them too? As just one example of how bad ANC are handling this crisis, at least 37 illegal aliens awaiting deportation have escaped from the Lindela Repatriation Centre outside Krugersdorp in Gauteng. Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi visited the center following the escapes which occurred on Sunday evening. Business as usual then. #WinterCometh is more to do with the ANC than with the virus?",sa-news,0
"#MakeChinaPay: While SA Establishment Kisses Chinas B*tt, The Rest of Africa Wakes Up To #CommunistCreep, Chinese Racism & Faulty Chinese Kits!","#AreYouKidding? Would a goat and pawpaw test positive for COVID-19 in South Africa with the Chinese swab testing kits donated by NASPERS & Jack Ma? Would they even tell us? Well they did in Tanzania! This and multiple other reasons has caused African nations to re-evaluate their relationship with China, and not only become more critical of China?s globalist ambitions, but also to see potential windfalls in suits against China, for not informing the world of the virus in time and also for racist incidents in China. The ANC regime in South Africa however continues to cover it all up with the SACP faction in the ANC, which is growing stronger in its attempts to oust Ramaphosa, pushing China?s communist agenda in all departments it has influence over. Chinese ownership in Independent Media (Argus, The Star, IOL, GQ, etc.) and NASPER?s Chinese interests (Tencent), no doubt help Chinese propaganda efforts in South Africa? While a senator in Nigeria has introduced a motion ? accusing China of institutional discrimination against Nigerians in China, more African nations are calling out China, with even Tanzania rejecting Chinese test kits after a goat and a pawpaw tests positive for COVID-19! Coronavirus test kits used in Tanzania were dismissed as faulty by President John Magufuli on Sunday, because he said they had returned positive results on samples taken from a goat. Tanzania was one of the first countries to receive these testing kits from Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who also donated to South Africa and the rest of Africa. As SA-News reported many European nations returned testing kits after the faulty kits exacerbated their fight against the CCPvirus. President Magufuli revealed at an event in Chato, in the northwest of Tanzania, that COVID-19 testing kits which had been donated by Jack Ma and imported from China had \""technical errors\"". Magufuli had instructed Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the kits, who then randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a pawpaw, a goat, and a sheep, but had given them human names and ages, and then submitted them to Tanzania?s laboratory to test for the coronavirus, without telling the lab technicians of their origins. Magufuli disclosed that samples from the pawpaw and the goat tested positive for COVID-19, saying \""We extracted a sample from a goat which turned positive. This tells you that something is not adding up.\"" Africa has caught on to the global outrage against China and nations joining in are increasing each day, as are the demands for reparations and for accountability. As usual the Chines Communist Party responds to this backlash like it always does, with a mix of threats and political correct rhetoric and who knows what else behind closed doors. More of this rhetoric is directed towards Africa because Chinese money has failed to buy the silence of the continent, except of course for South Africa, which is still under China?s spell, probably because of the heavy influence the South African Communist Party has on the ANC regime and China?s influence on many South African businesses and public sectors and government departments (the secretary general of the SACP is also the Minister of Education!) While African nations are increasingly wary of their dealings with Beijing after videos of racism against African expats in China did the rounds, African nations now want to sue China for such racism. A group of lawyers from Nigeria took the first step, seeking 200 Billion dollars from Beijing. Now this demand to #MakeChinaPay may soon get an official stamp after a Nigerian senator, Benjamin Kalu, moved a motion on the \""institutional discrimination\"" against Nigerians in China. The senator, who is the spokesperson of Nigeria?s house of representatives, has put up a long list of facts which influenced his decision: Nigerian citizens being treated as second-rate humans, worse than dogs in China The senator says that Nigeria ? China trade has generated eight Billion dollars in revenue and this should be enough to earn the respect that Nigerians deserve in China China?s \""parasitic relationship\"" with Nigeria. The senator says his country wants a relationship that is mutually respectful Senator Kalu says that Nigeria should not allow Chinese citizens into their country without an expatriate quota or work permit Breach of fundamental rights of Nigerians living in China The senator added that Nigeria?s ministry of justice will provide all financial support for Nigerian citizens who wish to seek redress for \""actionable causes\"". Nigeria is not the first country in Africa to challenge the bow down to China status quo. A number of other African governments are seeking redress and they have already lodged complaints with their respective Chinese embassies. Last month Ghana summoned the Chinese ambassador to express its disappointment. Ghana?s foreign affairs minister condemned the inhumane treatment of African expats in china. Uganda also summoned their Chinese ambassador last month over the harassment and mistreatment of its nationals. Kenya is seeking reassurances from its Chinese ambassador and its foreign ministry issued a complaint note in April. South Africa? Crickets? All these complaints led to the African Union (AU) speaking in one voice (with a mumble from SA), against China. Moussa Faki Mahamat from Chad, is the chairperson of the AU who summoned the Chinese ambassador Liu Yushi. He called out Beijing?s inaction over the rampant racial discrimination in China and the African Union expressed its \""deep concern\"" over the situation of Africans in the city of Guangzhou, However the global outrage goes beyond racism and beyond Africa, to various reasons for outrage. Kazakhstan for instance summoned the Chinese ambassador a few weeks ago when the Kazakh government protested against an article by the Chinese state media. The article pretended it was an idea that Kazakhstan was interested in becoming a part of China, they clearly weren?t interested in becoming another Tibet. France also had to summon the Chinese ambassador over Beijing?s propaganda in April when the French government expressed disapproval over a Chinese diplomat?s claims that France had left its older citizens to die! These are just a few of the many countries that have started pushing back against Chinese propaganda, imperialism and profiteering from the virus. How many more nations will it take before China understands the world is not interested in a Communist One World Order, not that communism allows people ot have a say. Needless to say South Africa?s obedience to China, and classifying Chinese as black for BBBEE purposes does not help. China must stop pretending to be the global leader and stop forcing itself on others with concealed carrot and stick agenda?s, or buying people and influence in global organisations like W.H.O. and UN?

"The Big Lie: In ANCs War Against The CCPvirus, Truth is the First Victim, but Ramaphosa Might Become One Too From ANC Infighting!  Analyst","As the totalitarian jackboot comes down hard on law abiding citizens in SA, a political analyst, who does not usually bash the ANC, says we are living in the time of the Big Lie. Prof Andre Duvenage a political analyst at the Potchefstroom University, has written an open letter to Cyril Ramaphosa in which he pulls no punches. Prof Duvenage wrote that in the future historians might look back and describe present day South Africa as the time of the Big Lie. He has blown the whistle and blown it hard over the ANC?s handling of the COVID-19 crisis. It is a long letter so we will only attempt to comment on the main thoughts of the letter. As the saying goes: In time of war, truth is the first victim. More evidence is pointing to the ANC reading and interpreting the COVID-19 crisis incorrectly, or maybe it was a deliberate and well planned exercise with hidden political motives and objectives, (like cracking down and establishing a ZANU-PF like police state, deepen discrimination and repression of the white minority, and make money from the emergency tenders justified during the COVID-19 crisis). Prof Duvenage wrote that the nature of this man (ANC) made disaster unfolding in front of us, will eventually be bigger than any worst case damage inflicted by COVID-19, and he is ominously spot on, for instance when considering that the Treasury department is now predicting job losses of 7 Million, which will cause tremendous hardship and famine. The disaster response has also allowed the regime to put us in a situation where we are now living under a dictatorship, complete with a sinister National Command Council controlling every aspect of our lives, even when we are allowed to exercise! Prof. Duvenage also points out that even if there was no political objectives with the lockdown declaration, it is now definitely a political battlefield for the faction supporting Ramaphosa on the one side, and the faction supporting the Zumas and Magashule on the other side. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (NDZ), who never smiles, is in charge of the National Command Council and Prof. Duvenage points to the fact that NDZ even vetoed Ramaphosa on smoking cigarettes, with Ramaphosa initially saying we could smoke in stage 4 and then \""Dr. Twak\"" NDZ saying we can?t. Whether her friend, Adriano Mazzotti, who is making millions out of illegal cigarette smuggling, has anything to do with her veto, is something we will probably never know. However, the cigarette debacle points to the weakness of Ramaphosa within the ANC and according to Prof. Duvenage, the political hyenas in the ANC are so active, that the Zuma/Magashule faction might even rope in Julius Malema to get numbers against Ramaphosa. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, is one of the first things they teach in commie school? \""What a political scenario for law abiding citizens\"" exclaims the Prof. Indeed, especially for the white minority that has to contribute so much to the state coffers, but who are now cut off from official assistance programs because they are white, and whose poor in squatter camps can?t even get a food parcel, because they are white. How moronic then must a white person be to still sing Ramaphosa?s praises? He is still the captain of the ship, although it is sinking. Is liberalism such a debilitating mental illness that you can?t see the forest for the trees anymore? The Prof. writes that as the crisis escalates, it has tremendous implications for democracy and stability in South Africa, although that ship has long since sailed. It is gone. He asks if this is not just another big looting and state capture exercise? For instance the over R 400 Million spent on Cuban doctors. How much of that landed in pockets of officials and politicians? Any money that did go to Cuba would be paid direct to the Castro Dictatorship there, who then only give 10% to the doctors themselves as a stipend! The Professor writes that the nation has had it with the ANC?s handling of COVID-19 like the ridiculous over regulation and arbitrary rules, together with the ANC flattening the economy and jobs instead of the COVID-19 curve. Prof, Duvenage writes that many are ready to start a campaign of civil disobedience and just start ignoring ridiculous and arbitrary rules and regulations. They are ready to rebel and tell Ramaphosa they will rather take their chances with the virus, than be killed off by another far worse virus ? the ANC. ",sa-news,0
"Has ANC Power Trip Made Lockdown More Dangerous Than Covid19? Permits Prevent Emergency Food Parcels Being Delivered, Threatening Mass Starvation While Long Queues Increase Contagion!","Power Corrupts and Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely ? These infamous words have come to define communism and are being proven to be true again in ANC South Africa. From a 3 kilometre queue where people stood shoulder to shoulder to massive crowds jammed together for food parcels, it seems the ANC power trip to control everything is in fact spreading the virus more! People cannot eat permits, regulations or policies yet a deranged ANC on a power trip is driving many families, both black and white, into starvation. Bureaucratic red tape created by a permit happy and regulation spewing ANC regime, trapped in a toxic mix of paranoia, racial hatred of minorities and tin pot power craving, is exacerbating the already existing hunger and threatening a mass famine in South Africa, because the corrupt ANC insists on controlling the distribution of food centrally, and in practice has stopped food being moved by many non governmental organizations (NGO?s) throughout the country, amidst the current COVID-19 lockdown which must be the hardest and most regulated lockdown in the world. Welfare organisations all over the country say they are being stopped in their tracks by officials who regard permits as more important than famine. It also looks like the permit system is being implemented so the ANC can control the flow of food, to make sure food don?t go to people who are not supporting the ANC (like the white community). Laurel Oettle, director of the Association for Rural Development in Pietermaritzburg told Rapport newspaper she wants to scream about it. She says her association has food and there is a big need in the KZN midlands area, but they are prevented from doing food deliveries because they cannot get the permits from officials. Oettle says the COGTA department of Nkosazana-Dlamini Zuma does not issue more than 3 permits per organization and a permit may only be used to give food to 5 people each, so they may only feed 15 people. Despite that her association has received 7,500 food parcels from the government?s Solidarity Fund (not the trade union). The ridiculousness of the ANC makes one?s head spin. Oettle says the food parcels are supposed to go to three areas in the midlands region with food shortages but they can?t take it because they cant get permits. Oettle says it is just crazy that bureaucrats (with fat salaries) are standing between people and food. Oettle says they fought for 3 straight days from Tuesday to get a permit but still do not have one! In Gauteng, the acting MEC for Social Development, Panyaza Lesufi (the same one who also wants to abolish Afrikaans schools), has issued an edict that that all food donations in Gauteng must be centralized and delivered to a government warehouse in Booysens (Johannesburg) ? where it will no doubt be looted or sold by government workers. If an organization wants to take food directly to people in need ? whoever they want to give it to (like for instance white squatter camps deliberately being ignored by ANC officials) ? they must first comply to several strict regulations and they must get a permit. The circular by Panyaza Lesufi creates a bureaucratic nightmare which will make it basically impossible to get food to people or a community who an individual or organization decides to give food to. An organization planning to deliver food to a particular community must apply to the Department 48 hours before the time. Once a permit is received ? very difficult to get it ? a person or organization must also first inform the Police and then still do the delivery of food in co-operation and conjunction with the Department (whatever that means) states Lesufi?s edict. In Witbank ? one of the most filthy and looted of all the ANC controlled municipalities ? the mayor, Linah Malatjie, has even threatened to arrest anyone who distributes food without the municipality?s written permission. Anyone who wants to give food to others must first get the municipality?s written permission. This by the way is a totally illegal thing and has no justification in law because a municipality can?t decide about such things. The municipality?s directive states that the permit issued by the municipality should indicate what sort of food is distributed and when and where it will be distributed. The municipal health inspector ? if they even have one ? must also first inspect the food. This past week a good Samaritan who wanted to give food to homeless people in Seapoint, Cape Town had to learn the hard way that no good deed will go unpunished by the ANC in the time of COVID-19. In a video taken of the incident it can be seen how Police are threatening the man with arrest and chasing him away. The Police spokesman told an inquiring Rapport that everyone who wants to give food to others needs a permit. He did not say how people will eat if his government don?t issue permits. It was quite apparent that it also was not his concern. Rapport asked the spokesperson of the Department of Social Development in KZN, Mashu Cele, why the organization Association for Rural Development in Pietermaritzburg is not allowed to distribute food in the KZN midlands. She however only accused the Rapport journalist of rudeness for asking such a question and hung up the phone. Rapport approached the KZN department after the national COGTA department said it is the KZN department?s responsibility to answer the question. Many many South Africans are running out of food whilst the government has developed into control freaks who seem to have a nefarious agenda to ensure they, and they alone, will control the delivery of food, to make sure that only their supporters get food. It was also widely reported in the media that local ANC councillors entrusted with distributing food have been stealing some of it and selling it. In research that was conducted 3 weeks ago by Victory Research for Rapport, it was found that 53% of all South Africans and 57% of black people simply don?t have money to survive a continued lockdown of 3 more weeks. Its now been 2 weeks since the research was done and the ANC wants to make it more difficult for those who don?t have food than ever. The extent of people?s needs were illustrated yesterday when thousands of people went to stand in queues at a school in Olievenhoutsbosch, Centurion, after receiving a false report that food would be handed out there. There were no signs of social distancing at all. No food parcels here Queues at a school in Olievenhoutsbosch, Centurion On Thursday about 8,000 people formed in a queue of 3 km long when local NGO?s handed out food at the Mooiplaas and Spruit informal settlements also near Centurion. Some of them had to leave empty handed because the food parcels ran out. Marius Ooshuizen, from the University of Pretoria, who was involved in the effort there told Rapport that they were also asked by the Gauteng Department of Social Development to deliver the food to the government but they decided not to comply. The ANC has lost all legitimacy. A dictatorship, a racist kleptocracy that will only thrive if we are going to be weak and obey their inhuman and illegitimate edicts. The ANC has lost all sympathy for normal people, slowly drowning in its self created paranoia. How many are there of us law abiding and freedom loving citizens, and how many regulation-serving simpleton officials are there, who are willing to serve an illegitimate hardcore dictatorship and willing to enforce rules that are unjust and in many cases racist? We owe it to those who are not getting anything to eat because of circumstances out of their control to give them something with which to fill their stomachs and the stomachs of their children. We can?t be forced to give donations away and we don?t know where it is going whilst our own kind, our own fellow whites and Afrikaners sit in squatter camps, and don?t get so much as a breadcrumb from an ANC regime that hates anything white with a passion. We should start to speak out and say if we agree with what is going on or not. We know for a fact that there are many people willing to help, and the rule should be that everyone should be allowed to help who they choose to, because they believe that is where the need is. We should not let anyone go hungry. That should be our departure point. ",sa-news,0
#Holodomor Is Ramaphosa Copying Joseph Stalins Deliberate Starvation Plan & Using Covid-19 To Boil The White Frogs Faster?,"We look at the ANC ?s step by step plan to achieve ethnic cleansing in Southern Africa, as it appears the ANC are using the COVID-19 crisis to reach sinister other goals like starvation, unemployment and putting whites out of business! Not only are the ANC only giving COVID19 aid to BBBEE businesses only, white squatters are not getting food parcels, but now the Afrikaans hating racist, Panyaza Lesufi plans to confiscate food donations from Afrikaner NGO?s, and give it to blacks! All this put together, with the denial of farm murders, banning of farm patrols, expropriation of what land without compensation, excluding white?s from the workplace & tertiary education with BEE laws, constantly digging up the ancient past to paint whites as bad, plus Ramaphosa?s \""boiling frogs\"" admission, reveals an evil Soviet Union style campaign of ethnic cleansing, similar to Stalin?s Holodomor. Like all communists, the ANC always works with a deceitful long term plan and Mario Oriani-Ambrosini, ex IFP MP, exposed Ramaphosa?s when he wrote in his memoires about the boiling frogs: \""In his brutal honesty, Ramaphosa told me of the ANC?s 25-year strategy to deal with the whites: it would be like boiling a frog alive, which is done by raising the temperature very slowly. Being cold-blooded, the frog does not notice the slow temperature increase, but if the temperature is raised suddenly, the frog will jump out of the water. He meant that the black majority would pass laws transferring wealth, land, and economic power from white to black slowly and incrementally, until the whites lost all they had gained in South Africa, but without taking too much from them at any given time to cause them to rebel or fight.\"" This is a communist strategy called incrementalism. It now seems that the ANC is using the COVID-19 crisis to drop all pretenses and take advantage of the opportunity the emergency powers give them, to openly implement their long term plan to destroy the white population in South Africa and take what they built, created and have worked for. It seems the ANC is speeding up their annihilation program of anything white and is becoming quite open about it. Lets take a look at what happened so far during the current COVID-19 crisis. STEP 1. First the ANC declared a total lockdown, stricter than any place in the world, even banning alcohol and cigarettes, and deployed the full might of the Police and Army to enforce it. Because of the official ANC policy to increasingly lock whites out from working in the public sector, many whites are forced to work for themselves in different sectors like tourism and other services, where they also employ many black people. But with their businesses closed by the lockdown, all these white families are left without an income and eventually many white families will not be able to pay for housing and even food. That was the first step the ANC took. STEP 2. Step 2 was locking whites out from official government assistance to survive the lockdown period and giving it to blacks only. The ANC first called it fake news that official government COVID-19 assistance will be given to blacks only. Then they dropped all pretenses when they openly defended their position in court that they will use their BEE policy ? which excludes whites ? to determine which businesses get official COVID-19 assistance from government departments. The case was brought by Solidarity and Afriforum and the government actually won High Court approval to help blacks only. Racism was enshrined by a court of law when Judge Jody Kolappen, who had previously served as the commissioner of the South African Human Rights Commission, ruled that it is fair and legal that the government can base its emergency assistance programs on the basis of skin colour, in the face of a pandemic that knows no colour. STEP 3. Now the ANC is getting ready for Step 3. The final solution it would seem, to cause mass starvation amongst many dirt poor white people, many living in squatter camps. So far food parcels distributed by the ANC through their political structures of local councillors, where it was reported in the media that a lot of food parcels were also stolen and sold in the black market, failed to reach a single white person in need, even those in squatter camps. The Solidarity Movement (Solidarity trade union and Afriforum) stepped in and helped these poor white families which otherwise would simply starve to death. The ANC now plans to intercept these food deliveries by NGO?s like Solidarity and Afriforum and re-direct it to ANC controlled government warehouses, where it will no doubt be looted by ANC cadres and either sold or re-directed to their black supporters. The first step in this direction was just given by the Gauteng Department of Social Development under the racist Panyaza Lesufi, well known for his desire to abolish Afrikaans schools, when they issued a directive that all food donated by NGO?s like the Solidarity trade union?s Helpende Hand charity, companies and individuals should not be distributed by them, but taken to a Gauteng government warehouse after which the ANC Gauteng government will decide who gets what. Stalin himself did a similar thing. The Solidarity trade union says they will continue with their programs and will not succumb to the government without a legal fight. They say the need is so great that their charity Helpende Hand don?t have enough as it is to help where they need to. It really looks like all the steps are being taken by the ANC to cause hardship, unemployment and famine on a wide scale in the white community. The facts are there, it is for everyone to see. We have been sounding the alarm bell on this, and are blowing the whistle. Please don?t allow this to happen. It can be prevented but only if the illegal commands of the murderously racist and now full-blown black fascist ANC are exposed end deposed. ",sa-news,0

Gauteng High Court Say Racism is Legal! ANC Can Award Emergency COVID-19 Aid to BBBEE Businesses Only! Solidarity to Appeal to Constitutional Court,"The ANC and the Gauteng High Court have said the ANC regime may use race based criteria when deciding which businesses receive emergency COVID-19 assistance. This from the same government who forcibly shut down these people?s businesses with the Lockdown, and who proudly proclaimed Corona Virus does not discriminate between races! Once again we see how the ANC regime is using the COVID-19 pandemic to put people out of business and onto welfare dependency, because that is the communist way? Solidarity trade union and Afriforum are going to appeal Judge Jody Kollapen of the North Gauteng High Court?s shocking decision, in a case brought by them on Tuesday 28 April, claiming that the Department of Tourism was not justified to use race based BBBEE criteria when deciding which small businesses get official taxpayer funded assistance in the lockdown period. It was clear for a long time that the courts are an extension of the ANC and that the Judicial system itself is rigged against the white minority, and the so called courts are justifying discrimination against white people on the basis of race. White people know already that they cannot expect any justice or fairness from either the ANC or its courts. Not even a food parcel? Judge Jody Kollapen only took 2 days to deliver his judgement in the case that Solidarity and Afriforum brought against the Department of Tourism. Kollapen. who made his judgement via email, probably due to fear of contracting COVID-19 himself, claimed that government departments are justified in using racist BBBEE laws to decide who gets COVID-19 assistance, and you can bet your bottom dollar that white people will get nothing, not a cent from any government department, even though it was the government who closed all businesses down, without giving businesses any choices or options. SA does not have courts anymore, but has ANC tribunals now which are justifying the most crude form of discrimination based on race, in the face of a deadly virus that knows no colour. Kallie Kriel of Afriforum said they will appeal to the Constitutional Court, to find out if the highest court in the land will put its stamp of approval on a racist system, that prevented white people from making a living and then cutting them out from official taxpayer funded assistance, just because they are white.

VIDEO: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Asks South Africa To Stop Cubas Human Trafficking of Cuban Medical Workers & to Pay Them Directly!,"In a scathing indictment of the ANC regimes communist credentials, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has asked South Africa to stop the Cuban dictatorship from turning a profit from human trafficking of Cuban medics, and to pay them directly and not to pay the Cuban regime which takes most of their earnings. Like the rest of the global communist movement, the regime in Havana has taken advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to continue its exploitation of medical workers. Pompeo thanked those countries that refused to turn a blind eye to these abuses and said no to them, or even returned the Cuban medics like Ecuador, Brazil, Bolivia and others did. He also asked others to do the same which is when he specifically mentioned South Africa and asked them to do the same. He said we must protect our medical workers now more than ever and governments who accept Cuban medical workers MUST pay Doctors directly, NOT via the Cuban dictatorship or the W.H.O. otherwise they are helping the regime turn a profit on human trafficking. Watch video here if it does not load above: https://youtu.be/ETCzm1cIz9Q Pompeo went on to say the WHO and ICC are politicized organisations, not a court and that authoritarian regimes are poorly designed to cope with pandemics. Follow The Money: The Wall Street Journal labelled Cuba?s international \""Doctor Diplomacy\"", where the Cuban regime keeps up to 90% of the doctor?s earnings from abroad, as Cuba?s slave trade. Cuba earned $6.3 Billion Dollars for medical services in 2018 alone, which is twice as much as Cuba earned on tourism! It appears the Cuban doctors coming to SA to \""help\"" is once again another Socialist scam to redistribute Emergency Fund donations and Taxpayer?s money to their fellow comrades, in the guise of civil services!

"How Much Has ANC Paid Cuban Medics? Cuban Dictatorship Keeps Most of Doctors Earnings, Making TWICE as Much from Sending Medics Abroad than from Tourism in 2018!","Follow The Money: The Wall Street Journal labelled Cuba?s international \""Doctor Diplomacy\"", where the Cuban regime keeps up to 90% of the doctor?s earnings from abroad, as Cuba?s slave trade. Cuba earned $6.3 Billion Dollars for medical services in 2018 alone, which is twice as much as Cuba earned on tourism! It appears the Cuban doctors coming to SA to \""help\"" is once again another Socialist scam to redistribute Emergency Fund donations and Taxpayer?s money to their fellow comrades, in the guise of civil services! South Africa has many unemployed well educated and qualified doctors and medics, however they are white and therefore it is illegal to employ them, besides, many of these whites fought against the commie Cubans in Angola and South West Africa? Since the CCPvirus pandemic spread from China, Cuba has sent more than 1,200 doctors and nurses to the frontlines of the battle against the virus to 22 countries, mostly into African and South America Socialist/Communist allies of the Cuban regime, including Venezuela, Jamaica, Nicaragua, China and most recently South Africa. As SA-News reported, 217 medical staff from Cuba are helping the ANC prop up its collapsing health system, and for decades in fact Cuba has used the sending of its doctors abroad, as a tool for diplomacy, promotion of Socialism and also plain simple crude profiteering and slavery. In fact Cuban state media tells us more than 400,000 health care workers have been sent abroad since 1963, so it is no wonder these medics are often seen as icons of Cuba?s socialist solidarity with other far left wing regimes. This commie cosy up is very evident when other countries oust their far left regimes, and elect new more centrist governments, which then send the Cuban medics back to Cuba like Bolivia did recently. While a few are sent on humanitarian grounds, many are in fact paying the Cuban regime directly for the Cuban medics? services. Some countries pay for the services directly to the dictatorship, while the poorer ones have the money paid for them, but to the World Health Organisation (W.H.O.) yes them, by richer donor countries, as part of their foreign aid donations. One wonders whether the ANC regime paid our hard earned taxes, or part of the Emergency Fund, to the Cuban dictatorship directly, or if some virtue signalling Western country paid it for them? Both the host country and W.H.O. pays the money into the dictatorships account, who then keeps the lions share and pays the medical staff a stipend with a promise to increase it a bit more when they return to Cuba. Is it any wonder the dictatorship in Cuba is so desperate to keep its power to preserve its very lucrative income stream? According to The Economist, medical exports make up 46 percent of the Socialist island?s export earnings! To put that into context, Cuba earned 6.3 Billion dollars for medical services in 2018 alone! That is twice as much as it earned on tourism! While it is a major source of income for the beleaguered impoverished Cuban regime, these doctors offer an even bigger prize: diplomatic prestige and the promotion of Socialism, as we saw when the ANC ministers lined up to welcome them and sing their praises, however many critics believe Cuba?s real interests are economic, ideological and diplomatic. The US State Department said in a statement to the Washington Post that Cuba?s deployment of medical missions overseas, while cloaked in altruism is actually a scheme to generate income that exploits Cuban medical workers. They went on to say Cuba?s medical missions program is not inherently humanitarian as the regime earned income by retaining up to 90% of the doctors salaries, while The Wall Street Journal had stronger words back in 2015 when it called Cuba?s international doctor diplomacy, it?s slave trade The dictatorship in Havana obviously denies the allegations. So when when ANC and SACP regime tells you it is key workers doing an essential job, saving lives, the long standing politics around it really cast a shadow on it because it has always been controversial since its inception, and it?s always been a key part of the Cuban Revolution ? the idea of sending brigades of doctors around the world to support like-minded Socialist nations and not necessarily to support nations that just need the help and have turned to Cuba for that. It is almost as if the communist movement are already trying to operate as a One World Government. This medical worker industry has almost become a key national industry as Cuba is somewhat of a medical powerhouse, as it boasts the world?s highest ratio of doctors to population. Venezuelan media suggest Cuba has as many as a hundred thousand doctors, or nine physicians for every thousand citizens and it?s free health care system is considered a pillar of the Socialist revolution?s implementation. As regards Cuba?s own readiness to fight the CCPvirus, Cuba was quick to take action with the pandemic and officially banned tourist arrivals, isolated at-risk groups and shut schools early when the country still only had around 21 confirmed cases, which was all rather simple given that it is a totalitarian dictatorship, and does not have much of an economy to speak of. Havana is seemingly doing well in the battle with CCPvirus and have only reported 48 new cases today with in total only under 60 deaths altogether since the CCPvirus spread from China, so they are cautiously optimistic that they are seeing the top of of the curve. Cuba is going to keep the restriction measures in place where people have to wear face masks. There are cases being brought against people who break the rules and because it is a very centralized totalitarian government, like China, people will get arrested if they break the law in many areas. Cuba already has a big question on the human rights situation on the island, but when it comes to this situation, Cuba?s centralized system means that the Cuban Communist Party just makes the decision, and it gets executed throughout the country. In a sense, while totalitarianism might be working in their favour, it is a mixed picture as there is still a lot of problems with social distancing in queues to find food, which is scarce in the best of times under a communist regime, but it is much scarcer now?

16 Black Police Officers Attack 6 White Family & Residents at Home! Is Ramaphosa & ANCs Anti White Racism Inciting Anti White Racism in Police & Black South Africans?,"Thanks to the constant anti white rhetoric from Ramaphosa and the ANC, SA has become a black Fascist Police State trying to ethnically cleansing a minority. In a shocking display of anti white racism and increasing State brutality, a group of 16 black Police officers burst into the house of a white family and residents making food at home, last Friday evening. What ensued can only be described as a litany of racial abuse and heavy handed police brutality against unarmed women! Donovan Maas, a financial advisor who was the only man of 6 white residents of the house in Westdene, Bloemfontein were told: \""What don?t you white people understand about being under lockdown? You just want to braai. You must rather f*ckoff\"". Despite seeing that there was no party going on, the Police group of 16 still saw fit to push the residents around, use vulgar racist language and Pepper spray Maas, his mother Sonette and another female who works for Maas, and also lives in the house with her 3 daughters, in the face. Sonette also became ill after she was dragged onto the pavement by 3 male Police officers and her gown was pulled off, leaving her exposed and undignified in her under garments in the cold. Her eye also became swollen because of the pepper spray. Maas said they were left traumatised and deeply humiliated from the incident and he feels deeply disturbed that such a large group could have invaded their privacy, racially abused them, assaulted them and all that whilst they are law abiding citizens who were just making food and filling hand sanitizer bottles. Where is their dignity? Maas says it is an out and out racist incident and a display of serious abuse and State violence in their own home. Maas says the only thing he did was ask for proper identification when the Police members first arrived at his house. As the only man in the house he felt obliged to make sure that criminals pretending to be Police officers don?t enter the house with the intent to rob them. House robberies by men dressed in Police uniform are not uncommon in South Africa. Maas says that when the 16 Police members burst into the rental property and shoved him and his mother, his cellphone was also slapped out of his hand. When Sonette said that the Police can?t act that way towards her son, she was sprayed with pepper spray in her face. This happened to the great enjoyment of one of the female Police members. The Police eventually had to withdraw when they realised that there was no party as they initially alleged. One member still told Maas that he will \""f*ck him up\"" and another Police member called the family \""white trash\"" as he was leaving. Maas made a Facebook post later asking President Ramaphosa why everything in the country always have to be about race. Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, SAPS spokesperson, told Netwerk24 that the Police reacted to a complaint of disturbing the peace but admitted there was no party at the house. Naidoo said the Police members left when they saw there were only residents at the house. He said Maas did open an assault case against the Police. Maas said on Facebook he wants to take it further because the rule of law has been replaced by a system of State officials believing they are the law. As SA-News reported earlier, Mr Wayne Scholtz, a neighbourhood watch member of Vanderbijlpark, was also badly assaulted last Wednesday by a group of high ranking off duty black Police officers who were standing outside a pub called Chillas drinking beer, after a funeral. The incident happened when Mr Scholtz wanted to make a cellphone video of this highly illegal activity amidst the lockdown period. Various other incidents of illegal arrests and assaults against community members by Police members have been reported in the lockdown period. Ramaphosa?s racism has always been subtle until the boiling frogs story came out from when he was a young activist in the ANC. He forgets that as President he represents all South Africans, not just the black welfare beneficiaries and employed cadres who sold their vote to him for grants and jobs.",sa-news,0
Solidarity Trade Union & Afriforum Challenge Ramaphosa in Court to Stop Being Racist About Covid-19 Relief for Businesses!,"Solidarity has directly challenged Ramaphosa to drop the racial BBBEE criteria for COVID-19 assistance to businesses in a letter sent on Saturday, to intervene in the Department of Tourism?s decision, to only give assistance to people who qualify under the ANC?s race based BBBEE policy for COVID-19 relief. The Department of Tourism has made R200 Million available to small and medium sized businesses in the tourism industry, as a relief fund during the COVID-19 lockdown period. These include all businesses in the sector like guest houses, but the minister of Tourism has said that this assistance will only go to people who qualify under BEE and \""economic transformation\"", which is the ANC?s code for black people only. Solidarity and Afriforum will be in court on Tuesday to challenge the decision. They have now asked Ramaphosa to rather intervene to make sure that assistance can go to everyone, irrespective of race. If the matter will not be settled out of Court, Solidarity and Afriforum will proceed with the Court application. The cut off date for Ramaphosa to react was yesterday. Solidarity has pointed out in the letter that black people, who constitute only 7% of the sector, will qualify for 100% of the R 200 million in the COVID-19 assistance relief fund. This is so because a lot of white people are forced to open a small business as the ANC?s BBBEE excludes them from the workforce in public workplace. These small business owners in the sector also employ a lot of black people. Solidarity has pointed out many legal arguments in the letter to Ramaphosa of why the actions of the Tourism Department is illegal when it comes to their COVID-19 relief fund. However given Ramaphosa?s insistence to push for expropriating white land without compensation, being racist does not seem to bother him in the slightest.",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: When Will Black South Africans Take Off Their BBBEE Nappy & Abolish Expropriation Without Compensation Too? \""Freedom for Some is Freedom for None\""","#FreedomDay When Will Black South Africans Take off Their BBBEE Nappy? When will black South Africans grow up and be free? In his usual racist Freedom Day rant, #RacistPhosa admitted just how far South Africa is from being a free country. In fact it begs the question: At what stage will black South Africans no longer be kept in a protected crib and artificially supported and sustained by racist ANC policies like BBBEE? No black person in SA can really feel sure that they actually achieved what they have by themselves. \""Freedom for Some is Freedom for None\"" says Ramaphosa on Freedom Day as his government shuts out white people whose income was cut off by the official lockdown, from government relief assistance and aggressively pursues the policy of expropriating land from white people without compensation. Ramaphosa has held his official Human Rights day rant on Monday and stressed the fact that nobody will have rights if only some have rights. He was of course heavily dwelling on the ancient past, half a century ago, and implying the usual white man bad, black man good, when in fact the situation now is totally reversed. Apartheid is under new management ? ANC management, for the benefit of blacks only. His rant was ironic because the ANC has driven a social engineering, self enrichment scheme called BBBEE for 26 years. It stands for Black Economic Empowerment and was misused over the years to favour ANC aligned black business people in official government spending. All large corporations were also forced to turn over large chunks of their shareholding to ANC aligned black business people. In short the ANC regime is openly discriminating against the white minority and has in effect totally cut them out from the formal economic, education & welfare sectors, including not giving them jobs in government institutions and departments simply because they are white. As we have previously reported the ANC government has even decided to have a blacks only approach with funds set aside to assist small business people who work for themselves and were cut off from earning a living with the hard lockdown imposed by the government. The words of Ramaphosa are therefore hollow in the face of the actions of his regime. How can we all feel united if we as a minority are continually discriminated against and are even discriminated against in the face of a pandemic that is affecting all of us equally? His government is also totally bypassing impoverished white people who were driven into squatter camps through the ANC economic policy that cuts white people out from the formal economy. Food parcels are being delivered in black townships but not in white squatter camps? ",sa-news,0
High Ranking Black Police Officers Drinking At Funeral Party Assault White Neighbourhood Watch Member Filming Them Disobeying Lockdown Regulations!,"#AbuseOfPower In yet another example of police officers disobeying lockdown regulations and abusing their power, high ranking police officers whose illegal activity was filmed by a neighbourhood watch member at a popular pub, Chillas in Vanderbijlpark, assaulted the cameraman and deleted the footage! This nationwide abuse of power and petty vindictive interpretation of the law in many cases, by the police has many wondering if the lockdown regulations are turning SA into a corrupt Police State. Mr Wayne Scholtz (53), a Neighborhood watch member from Vanderbijlpark, was assaulted on Wednesday in front of a popular pub in Vanderbijlpark when he stopped to take a cellphone video of a group of men, including police officers, standing outside the well known pub drinking beer. According to a VF+ Councillor, Gerda Senekal, there was a funeral after party held at the premises on Wednesday which was attended by several senior Police officers. This would of course be against the lockdown regulations in various ways because no business premises are allowed to be open, no alcohol is supposed to be consumed and gatherings are also not allowed during the lockdown period. These are the regulations which were enthusiastically enforced on members of the public by SAPS during the last 4 weeks of the lockdown. Furthermore, if it is true that there were police officers from all over the country at the pub, one automatically wonders how they got permission to travel, because travel over provincial borders is now also against the law in the lockdown. Mr Scholtz told Rapport newspaper that he stopped in front of the pub on Wednesday afternoon because there had been gatherings there for several days, especially last weekend. Somebody had also mentioned the loud gathering at Chillas on the day and had wondered if it was only lockdown for some? Several complaints of drinking and rowdy behaviour at Chillas were also received at the Barrage Police station on the day. Mr Scholtz says that he was standing next to his vehicle at the driver?s side when the group consisting of about 12 men stormed him. He was beaten over the back of the head with a beer bottle just after he dropped his phone in the vehicle. He was also beaten with fists all over his body. The men tried to drag him out of the vehicle whilst the blows rained all over his upper body. He crawled up to protect his face. The men also took his keys from the ignition and beat him with the immobilizer which is part of the keyring while shouting \""delete\"" to him the whole time. The men took his phone in the meantime and deleted the video. One of the men also threatened that he can also \""shoot\"" like Mr Scoltz, pointing at his hip. He must have referred to Mr Scholtz \""shooting\"" a cellphone video (which would be legal since the group of men were busy with an illegal activity). Mr Scholtz told Rapport that the local on-duty Police later arrived at the scene and that one of the attackers told the local Police that he was a Brigadier, although Mr Scholtz says according to his information the man was a only a Captain. A female colonel told Mrs Senekal who had arrived on the scene that it is not the Police?s job to keep the drinking group and the neighbourhood watch apart because it is their \""culture\"" to hold funerals (as if only a certain group holds funerals and have the right to do it whilst others cannot not to mention drinking after parties). Mrs Senekal said the funeral was attended by high ranking SAPS members from all over the country, including Colonels and Brigadiers. Mr. Scholtz has made a statement to Police with regards to the assault on him. Mr. Scholtz Mr. Scholtz This flagrant beating of an innocent law abiding man by a group of men in authority, who are supposed to uphold the law comes against the background of extremely zealous enforcement of the lockdown regulations, on ordinary members of the public by SAPS members all over the country. This has resulted in scores of illegal arrests of people who have for instance just gone to the shops to buy food or the pharmacy to get medicine. Beatings were dished out on a regular basis as if the rights of people were suddenly suspended. The Rapport had another report where they mention several bizarre incidents of Police illegality, brutality, overkill, pettiness and heartlessness in their lockdown enforcement operations. These include: Werner Smit, a Kwikspar manager in Bellville, was arrested at his shop and detained for 6 hours because he committed a crime according to local SAPS by selling hot food. He had to pay R1,000 bail to be released. The true fact is that that shop does not sell hot food but packets of food that has to be heated at home! In the Vaaldriehoek a group of 10 SAPS members arrived at the Walking with Winners drug rehabilitation centre at De Deur on Monday and confronted Pastor Dave Barber. They were under the mistaken impression that the centre?s licence had already expired, but it only expires at the end of April. One SAPS member also shoved Pastor Barber in the incident. Pastor Barber now wonders if the Police will evict his people during the Corona crisis? A pensioner of Johannesburg, Ianthe Yelland (64), the wife of the well known energy analyst and writer, Chris Yelland, almost landed in jail this past Monday when she wanted to report a motor vehicle accident that she was involved in when she went out to buy food. The constable reckoned she acted illegally by coming to the Police station, threatened her with arrest and eventually chased her away. The Police only apologized after Mr. Yelland tweeted about the incident to his substantial following. Mr Deon Coetzee of the Vaaldriehoek told Rapport that Police did not want to issue him with a permit to take food to a desperately poor white family who are trapped on a smallholding in De Deur. The family is Anniekie Viljoen who has gangrene in her leg, her son Ryno (12) and husband Marius Janse van Rensburg (55). Marius hawks key rings on the street for a living but can?t do it because of the lockdown. Mrs Viljoen says a church minister wanted to bring them food last weekend but was also prevented by Police. These mentioned incidents are just the tip of the iceberg. ",sa-news,0
"\""The Great Reset\""  Will ANC Cope, Will Minorities Wake Up, and Will The Failed Liberal World Orders Globalism & Open Borders be Finished?","The CCPvirus, as it is known due to the Chinese Communist Party?s failure to warn a globalist world, has rolled like a giant tsunami through the world. Although it has not flattened a single building, it has flattened economies, forced families apart and killed many of their loved ones. Governments are scrambling to deal with the problem and most have adopted phrases like \""flatten the curve\"", \""lockdown\"" and \""phased reopening\"" to manage the state and public response, in such a uniform way, globally, it almost seems some central body is giving instructions to the likes of Ramaphosa and ANC, who certainly would not have come up with these managed responses on their own. Likewise most nations rapidly enacted historically huge spending plans, and so too did the ANC regime when Ramaphosa announced a massive spending plan of R500 Billion, money SA does not have, but Cyril has already been told where it will come from: a \""social bond\"" from globalist banksters using the crisis to enslave larger parts of humanity, but at what price? These social bonds require certain social strategies (liberalisation, social compact, radical transformation) and boil down to globalist orgs dictating globalist progressive policy to nation sates. However the short term emergency plans are nothing compared to the enormity of the problem we face in the here and now. The plan for the \""smart lockdown\"", as the phased lifting of lockdown restrictions and the creation of breathing room for people and business is called, \""requires levels of sophistication that the state has yet to display\"", writes Pieter du Toit from News24. Ramaphosa?s carefully written sixth address during the coronavirus pandemic, showed South Africans the ANC?s big intentions of how the first steps out of the lockdown will look, but as we know all too well, the ANC clearly does not have the experience or ability to cope with the large pitfalls in the way before any semblance of normality will return. What they do have however, thanks to a largely compliant mainstream media, is the power of spin, to censor and control the narrative and the ability to silence and hide from the masses what is really going on at ground level. Do South Africans fawning over Ramaphosa?s well written speech, realise the harsh economic impact the lockdown and worldwide CCPvirus crisis will have on our economy? The job losses that we can now expect? The impact that that will have on the lives of many people? The inevitable rise in violent crime, which was already through the roof. Jakkie Cilliers from Institute for Security Studies said the threat of violence over lack of food and income is real. \""The reality is simply that poor people in informal settlements have no option but to find ways of getting food and sustenance on the table. So I think there is a significant threat and concern about this,\"" he said. Jakkie added that the letter in which Ramaphosa asked Parliament to approve the huge deployment of additional SANDF soldiers showed the government anticipated big problems. \""I think the decision to deploy over 70,000 members of the SANDF makes it very clear that government is very worried about the potential of food riots and broad criminal activity,\"" he said noting that problems with this type of violence is that it escalates quickly by gaining momentum and spilling over into large areas of townships and squatter camps. \""The intention with the SANDF deployment is to try and make sure that you don?t have that momentum, that you squash it right at the start,\"" he explained, but, the \""perilous\"" state of the army itself may serve to worsen the situation, even thought the size of deployment is unprecedented, those military officials are not trained or prepared for this, Cilliers said. \""So I think we are gonna see significant tensions and a rising number of issues about how the military acts in trying to clamp down on this.\"" The points of attack would be places where there are perceived to be food and resources. \""We are going to see the kind of attacks we?ve seen on delivery vans, maybe on spaza shops, and so on,\"" Cilliers also said to MyBroadband. Johan Rupert was recently interviewed by the Financial Times magazine in an article called The Great Reset which can be googled. Rupert saw the 2008 financial crisis coming. When he says we face big, big trouble now, you can believe him. Also take note of what an economist told the Financial Mail. He said after the 2008 financial crisis, we lost 850,000 jobs. How many will we lose now? In the interview Rupert says he realised in 2011 already that China is a volcano and would explode one or the other time, doesn?t matter if it takes 10 or 20 years. Well, China just exploded. The economic consequences will be severe. Rupert and company is talking about The Great Reset in terms of the need for the ANC to drop its economic dogma, the need to restructure SOE?s etc. But truth is, it goes further than that. The cause of all this is the China volcano and the CCPvirus is going to tear apart the politically correct globalist plans of liberal elites, and their funders like IMF, World Bank, WHO, George Soros, etc. (that is if Soros hadn?t already shorted the market and profited from the world?s misery as he has done before). We have to change the way the world thinks and operates. The very first thing we have to realise is that globalism with its liberal open borders agenda should be declared dead after the arrival of the CCP virus. Countries with strong borders like Hungary withstood the CCP virus better than open border countries like UK, Spain, Italy, Belgium and the USA. Countries with strong border controls and proper control over national sovereignty, like Poland, fared much better during the CCPvirus. The future of the world should not be left in the hands of George Soros so that he can implement his open borders agenda further. He will just open the way further for the Chinese volcano to explode again and again. In South Africa specifically, where we saw how inept and unprepared our ANC government is, we should realise that the ANC will not do anything for minorities. They are already cutting whites out from COVID-19 aid and assistance. We should realise that the liberalism that took hold of us as a white minority will kill us because we have become a people who lost our identity, egged on by liberal ideology and consumerist greed. We have accepted the every man for himself or herself concept, as is accepted by liberal ideology. We can only move forward, survive together, if we help each other. We have to adopt the concept of #Helpmekaar, the same concept that pulled Afrikaners up by their boot straps after war and depression. We have to realise that without an identity we wont know who we are and where we are going. We have to realise that nobody will help us besides ourselves . We need to stand together, work together in a movement of the people like the Jews have done for centuries, even when they had no country, and which has helped them to survive to this day. Failing that, we can kiss our future goodbye because the globalists are all to keen to take it away.

Neither the Covid19 Lockdown or Ramaphosa Can Stop #FarmMurders! Three More Grandparents Murdered & Three Left Seriously Wounded Despite Lockdown!,"#CoronaVirus is not the only thing killing our old people. Cowardly barbaric attacks on old white people by cowardly black perpetrators, preying on innocent, vulnerable, soft targets continue in South Africa. Despite the lockdown, three have been murdered and three seriously wounded. This kind of brutal attack by cowardly black gangs on whites have been happening since the ANC were given control, and the puppet liberal media are complicit in allowing farm murders to go on, even coming up with irrelevant apologist excuses to hide their complicity and treason. The murderers were not content to just shoot Jack de Vries (65) in the neck during the attack in the early morning hours of Tuesday 21 April in his house in Cullinan. No, they had to beat him with a pick-axe handle too, so hard that his wife Desiree could hear bones in his body breaking with every blow. When his brother-in-law Braam Koekemoer later saw Jack?s dead body, it was swollen three times its usual size! Braam told Netwerk24 that Jack and his wife Desiree (57) were attacked at around 03:00 that morning in their house at the Magaliesoord treatment centre for drug and alcohol addicted people, which is situated on the Zonderwater prison grounds. Desiree is the deputy director of the centre and Jack served as the \"" house father\"" of the centre. The three black male attackers must have known exactly who they were going to attack because they came on a secluded gravel road which runs adjacent to the prison, broke the fence and then broke a window to gain access to the house. When Jack and Desiree woke up, the 3 attackers were on top of them. Jack tried to fight back whilst Desiree ran down the passage. One attacker chased her and bound her hands and feet. It was whilst she was lying bound, praying that she wont be raped, that she heard the heavy blows landing on Jack?s body. Then the attackers shouted to Desiree: \""Where is the money b*tch!\"" She told them they had no cash but she had to give them their bank card pins. The attackers also opened the safe, took firearms, 2 TV?s and some other valuable items and fled. Desiree managed to untie herself and called for help, however when the ambulance left, Jack blew out his last breath, and the ambulance turned around so that Desiree could greet him. Jack was a detective in the Police?s stock theft unit. Karen Yssel of the local Community Police Forum told Netwerk24 that Oom Jack was much loved in the community and much respected. Can anyone imagine how cruel it is to have the life beaten out of you whilst already incapacitated by a bullet like Jack was? Desiree was also beaten with a heavy object over the body and with a pistol over her head? Jack de Vries & DesireeJack de Vries & Desiree Tannie Joekie Nortje (82) and her son Johan (62), were attacked for the second time in less than a year on their farm Nooitgedacht, outside of Louis Trichardt on 20 April 2020, at around 07:00. This time the farm attack was just more brutal and their injuries even more serious than the last time. Dippies Nortje told the Zoutpansberger that his mother and brother were seriously tortured. Tannie Joekie was attacked when she went out to feed farm animals, by 4 black male attackers, who demanded money. They cut her hands when she told them that she had no cash. She and Johan sustained various cut and stab wounds, also on their heads. The safe, which is heavy, was loosened from the wall and an unknown amount of cash was also taken. Tannie Joekie was taken to the Zoutpansberg Private hospital but Dippie Nortje said he was not allowed in the hospital because of COVID19 and is waiting for more news. He said his mother was also hit with a chair and he thinks her ribs are broken. Tannie Joekie?s son Dippies told Zoutpansberger that five men arrived on Nooitgedacht on 27 May, 2019 and pretended that they wanted to buy pigs. When Johan and a farm worker walked to the pigs, they were overpowered and tied up. In the house the attackers demanded money from Tannie Joekie, but she could not give them anything, and they ransacked the whole house. Tannie Joekie and Johan were both seriously assaulted before they fled, with only Tannie Joekie?s handbag, a little cash and an air gun. Johan was transferred to the Medi Clinic in Polokwane with bleeding on the brain. Tannie Joekie sustained serious cut and hack wounds from a panga. She was transferred to the Medi Clinic in Tzaneen. Tannie Joekie?s hands were in a bad state with an artery, muscles and sinews chopped off. Tannie Joekie Tannie Joekie Nortje In addition to the attacks on the De Vries couple and Tannie Joekie and her son that happened this week, 2 more murders on elderly white people happened in the last 2 weeks of lockdown. An 82 year old male, name unknown, was murdered in Akademie street, Franschhoek on Thursday 9 April. Tannie Rienie Verster (85) was also murdered on Wednesday evening 15 April in Riviersonderend. No arrests were made in any case except the Franschhoek case. Once again, it must be stressed that these kind of attacks and murders are an almost daily occurrence since the ANC took over and the message got out that the ANC would tolerate it. The world and South Africa?s liberal press could not care less and almost seem to encourage it with their constant demonisation of white people. ",sa-news,0
#LetThemEatCash! Ramaphosa Creating Historic Debt to Appease Township Masses! Faulty Test Stats & Cash Wont Stop CCPvirus Nor Will it Protect Food Producers & Shops!,"#CoronaClown: Despite having months to learn from what other countries have gone through, Cyril seems intent on sticking to the African Way, as he tries to control the narrative and drip feed the black masses with unrealistic faulty test information, bankster inspired \""relief\"" payouts to quell uprisings in townships, and to deny the inevitable, a catastrophe and his demise. SA-News reported over TWO months ago that asymptomatic COVID19 positive people were silently spreading the virus, now suddenly it is a scientific revelation? Cyril mentions food security, but not farm security? Like Zimbabwe, you can only throw so much cash at a problem until it becomes worthless, because it cannot be eaten and doesn?t reach those that need it most, because corrupt ANC politicians intercept and plunder the funds. However Cyril is forced to use the carrot because Bheki Cele?s increasing unpopularity from extreme childish lockdown restrictions have reduced Cyril?s options. South Africa is using the same testing kits as India, who have stopped using these Chinese testing kits because ONLY 5.4% of the kits give an accurate result. As SA-News reported, many other countries have stopped using Chinese Covid-19 supplies, yet why is SA then getting supplies from China? The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has advised all states not to use rapid test kits for two days as a different kit is showing different results. Meanwhile the bullying actions of the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, during the lockdown will come up in Parliament when the body is back in session, as there are several comments and instructions Cele gave as minister to his police, that directly contradict what Ramaphosa ordered. Cele apparently said at the start of the lockdown that people should be pushed into their homes, and the police should not be kind to the people. While the severity of the situation might justify it, this is possibly a comment that could have contributed to the deaths of eight people due to police action. Bheki Cele?s remarks about a woman allegedly raped by a police officer have also caused uproar and are being held directly against the minister who is also being blamed for his directive to police to destroy private property if alcohol sales occur. Reports are that more than 200 complaints were received during the lockdown by police who acted unlawfully against members of the public. So not having a stick anymore and prompted by globalist Banksters & WMC whispering in his ear, Cyril Ramaphosa announced a carrot of R500 Billion for the masses as the country battles the CCPvirus pandemic. In his address to the nation on Tuesday night, Ramaphosa almost gloated that this is as huge as 10% of the Gross Domestic Product of SA. The R500 Billion spending is the country?s biggest single financial outlay and is almost ten times the amount spent preparing for hosting the Soccer World Cup 2010. The intervention which our great great grandchildren will still be paying off, and will see SA forced to commit to implementing even more globalist \""progressive\"" policies, includes the following major handouts: R200 Billion wholesale loan scheme for major banks who are stressed due to bad loans to corruption. A R50 Billion appeasement cash handout for grant recipients (ANC core voters) R100 Billion for jobs/cadre deployment ? pitting unqualified bums in extra seats to pay excessive salaries for doing nothing? R70 Billion in tax relief, (to make up for lost revenues from alcohol & tobacco sales?) R20 Billion for municipalities of whom most are bankrupt and under administration by corrupt administrators. A mere 250 000 very overpriced food parcels, in a country where over 15 Million are unemployed. Over R100 Million to help protect frontline workers (more faulty Chinese PPE?) Indeed Corona virus is the gift that never stops giving to the ANC! All the problems about bankrupt parastals and bailouts are forgotten too. And after all that, Cyril has still not addressed the actual virus or what is really happening in the real world. The NHLS uses tests which are done on viral genetic material taken from nose and throat swabs. The test uses a molecular biology method called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a high through-put machine that works by extracting the viral genetic information from a patient?s sample and \""reproduces\"" the genetic sequence (essentially creating more of the genetic material) to make enough of it to test for the virus? DNA. The NICD tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through this polymerase chain reaction (PCR) molecular test. The science is accurate, but the cheap Chinese machines are not, and it is almost certain the process of gathering samples is open to abuse, corruption and errors. It costs R1,400 for a private test, but government tests are free and it is not unheard of for cadres to sell what is otherwise free. Gauteng has over 120 positive tests results where they have lost track of the patient or the patient has absconded, and nationally a few dozen positive cases cannot be traced to a province, so are left \""unallocated\"". Professor Tulio de Oliveira, a geneticist and Director of KRISP ? a Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform in KwaZulu-Natal, said PCR tests can pick up positive cases before a person displays any symptoms. \""This is very important especially for health care workers who, if positive for the virus, can self-isolate and prevent the infection from passing onto others.\"" He however warned that with high demand from countries across the globe it would be difficult to get a steady supply of reagent, an ingredient for PCR tests. This is why SA is testing only symptomatic cases, leaving the asymptomatic cases to spread. SA needs to test a lot more and a lot more accurately, fast. Dr Kamy Chetty, Chief Executive Officer of the NHLS, however claimed there is adequate testing capacity and equipment to meet the demand in South Africa. \""The NHLS is pursuing various sources of supplies to obtain PCR-based test kits and has a commitment from suppliers that South Africa will be a priority,\"" she said, however this all seems to be undone by faulty machines? Adding to the COVID-19 testing arsenal, Dr Chetty had claimed more than 180 GeneXpert analysers will be made available in all provinces for testing by April, this month, but no word on them yet? GeneXpert machines are already being used extensively in SA to test for tuberculosis and was approved by the FDA in US last month, when the company had started production. The test kits were due to arrive this month, but still no word? there was talk of converting the TB machines we currently use, but once again, it seems it is all talk? ",sa-news,0
"ANC Regime Misuses #COVID19 To Expose Farmers To Harm, Attacks & Stock Theft by Banning Farm Patrols in Remote Rural Areas! Deliberate?","#CCPvirus: South African farmers are now at the mercy of barbaric livestock raiders, crop thieves, poachers and farm attackers while minister Bheki Cele, closely surrounded by his bodyguards, bans farm watch patrols by farmers themselves. Farmers across South Africa are reporting that livestock and crop raiders are slowly carrying their livestock and crops away whilst the same ANC regime, that demands that farmers feed the nation, fails to protect them, even preventing them from conducting patrols in groups to try to protect their property, crops and livestock. The need for farm watch patrols is now more important than ever but the minister of Police, Bheki Cele, has now prohibited farm watch patrols as part of the government?s Chinese Corona virus lockdown regulations. Farmers, especially in the Free State, recently reported that their mealies are stolen off their lands and carried off in bags to the townships, to be sold and consumed. Now a gruesome video which was widely circulated on social media, showing sheep which were stolen and freshly slaughtered on a farm near Senekal in the Free State, caused much anger amongst farmers who heard that Minister of Police Bheki Cele prohibited them from conducting farm patrols. Dirk van Niekerk, owner of the sheep that were stolen and slaughtered, told Netwerk24 that he discovered on Friday morning that 58 of his sheep were gone. He followed the trail of the sheep for 8 km until he discovered the place where some sheep lay slaughtered in the field on a neighbouring farm. The meat was still warm and the thieves must have fled when they saw people approaching. 14 sheep had been slaughtered at that time at place that was right next to the R70 road, and Van Niekerk believes that someone was going to come collect the meat there with a vehicle. The rest of the sheep were discovered still alive in an old abandoned building nearby. Van Niekerk said that just the previous week another 26 sheep were stolen from him of which he found only 6 back. He says that thieves will target a farmer until he is eventually forced to stop farming with sheep, and then the thieves start at the next farmer, putting them out of business. The DA, Afriforum and TLU SA all asked that the minister reconsider the senseless banning of farm watches. Stock theft by hacking and chopping gangs is a common problem on South African farms. The hacking gangs raid farms, chop the hind tendons of the cattle and sheep so that they cant run away and then slaughter the animals in the field. Sometimes cattle and sheep raiders will chase the animals to where they can slaughter it. This could be in the field or sometimes the slaughter happens in townships where the meat is sold for profit to shops in the townships, not hunger as they would no doubt claim if caught?

Transform or Starve! ANC Regime Misusing COVID19 Aid to Blackmail Whites to Give Businesses to Blacks! COVID19: Turning Capitalism into Socialism!,"Leninism comes to SA: The COVID19 crisis is not only making Black South africans realise that the ANC are the african version of champagne socialists, i.e. despots who make false promises and will let their own people starve, but it is also exposing the ANC?s overt racism. The ANC openly says they won?t assist white small business owners with emergency or taxpayer funds unless they \""transform enough\""! A spokeswoman for the Department of Tourism has admitted that no government COVID19 assistance will be given to any white owner of a business in the tourism sector. The department made R200 Million available for small and medium sized businesses in the tourism sector so that they can apply for funds in the lockdown period. Businesses in the tourism sector like guesthouses and tour operators cannot make any money because of the lockdown regulations and the restriction of international flights. The minister of Tourism, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, has previously spelt out in an official document that the ANC?s Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) codes and \""economic transformation\"" principles will be used when determining how the R200 Million assistance money will be spent. That means according to the ANC that 70% of businesses receiving State help must be black, half must be owned by women, 30% owned by youth and 4% owned by people with disabilities. It was also spelt out like that in the Tourism Department?s document. Nobody should believe the ANC?s lies anymore because whatever racial quota system they say they will use, it will not really be followed and only black people will be helped in the end. BEE simply encourages and empowers blacks to be racist towards whites. Afriforum is taking the Tourism department to Court to try to ensure that the race of those applying for help will play no role, but the minister even denied the court proceedings, despite court papers being served (Case No. 21399/2020). Rapport asked the spokesperson of the Tourism minister, Hlengiwe Nhlabathi-Mokota, on Friday why the Tourism Department is opposing Afriforum?s application in Court and the only response she could come up with was to say that white small business people in the tourism sector in 2020 did not \""transform enough\"". She did not say what she meant by that. Afriforum hopes that the case can be brought before the High Court as soon as Tuesday. The racist prejudice against whites was confirmed by 2 white small business owners in the tourism sector who Rapport spoke to. The 2 white male guesthouse owners have confirmed to Rapport that they are not being helped. Johan Bloem who operates the Aandbloem guest house in Centurion ? where he employs 4 black women ? says he submitted his help request to the Tourism Department on 10 April and he has not heard anything back. He has no guests at the moment and can?t generate an income. Rapport also spoke to a guesthouse owner in the Bergrivier area on the West Coast who employs 6 people. That owner said his application to the Tourism Department failed and he was told he does not qualify. Solidarity trade union has a separate court case pending against the Department of Small Business Development in which it asks the Department to fully disclose what criteria the Department will use to determine who will get COVID-19 assistance. It also wants the Court to forbid the government to discriminate against white small business owners on the basis of race. It should be noted that the ANC regime said in the beginning of the lockdown period that it is fake news that white people would not be helped by the State during the lockdown period. The mainstream liberal media then repeated the ANC fake news claim, like good puppets. But the truth has now emerged, like it usually does, and its clear the ANC and its puppet media told us fake news when they said the ANC government won?t discriminate against white people. Distributing fake news during the lockdown period was declared a crime by the ANC government and the Police arrested several people over fake news. The question now is if the ANC will report at the nearest Police station so that they can be arrested and locked up on fake news charges? What gives them the right to lie? Analysis ? The ANC?s discrimination with regards COVID-19 assistance in the tourism and small business sectors comes down to an attempt to ensure that white people who operate businesses can?t continue to do so unless they give more of the business to blacks, or stop operating, allowing black businesses to take over their market. In which case they would not be in a position to earn an income and put food on the table for them and their families. The ANC already makes it impossible for white people to get formal employment in the government sector and most ordinary white people have no choice but to work for themselves. They have to pay higher rates and taxes to subsidise townships and there is no sympathy or forgiveness from local authorities if accounts like water and electricity are not paid. The black authorities will simply come and close the taps and cut off electricity on the first day! Whites already face double and triple discrimination everywhere they turn, and this latest refusal from the ANC to assist people, in a time of crisis because they are white, smacks of communist Leninism, and just proves that the ANC believes that they and black people own the country exclusively and they alone should be in line to get assistance from taxpayer funds. Let us see if the Courts will take the side of the black supremacist ANC and legalise open discrimination against whites in a time of crisis, in a situation where the ANC government forbids free movement and economic activity under the extended lockdown, and is trying its best to make the lives of South Africans hell, with increasingly petty lockdown regulations whilst seemingly giving their voter base like taxi owners and informal traders in black townships the right to operate.

New SA Army Chief Has Outstanding Murder Charges Against Him For Botched Grenade Attack! Hypocrisy of SA Justice System is Literally Black & White!,"Blacks Go Free, Whites Get Punished Hard! The new SA Army Chief, who could not even attack an unarmed building, has outstanding murder and attempted murder charges against him, that have never been prosecuted, even though he was denied amnesty by the TRC, because his botched grenade attack on Trust Bank in Kimberley, had no political objective that was part of the past struggle. The Foundation for Equality before the Law has expressed its shock over the appointment of Lawrence Mbatha as the Head of the SA Army a week ago, when the Parliamentary Committee on Defence welcomed his appointment. The failed hand grenade attack in Kimberley, which occurred during an ANC protest march to the Bophuthatswana Consulate (The Independent Tswana Homeland), saw the two MK operatives throw the hand grenade at the Trust Bank building, but it bounced back into the crowd, killing one person and injuring 41 others, including an American, Jonathan Maurice and Adriano Cassandra, from the United Nations Observer Mission. Four MK / ANC members, two of whom denied guilt, applied for amnesty but it was refused (AC/2000/053 and AC/2000/241). Chairman of the Foundation for Equality before the Law, JP Botha, said that Mbatha?s appointment proves, once again, that South Africa has a rotten criminal justice system where the National Prosecution Authority (NPA), which is controlled by the ANC, practices selective justice where the laws are only applicable to some but not to others. One can see it as clear as black and white, because that appears to be the criteria being used to determine if someone should be punished or not. Only the really naive, or those benefiting from this corrupt system, would pretend everyone is treated equally before the law in SA. For example, the Boeremag guys (coerced and sponsored by the State Secret Intelligence Services), also accidentally killed one person with a bomb, for clear political reasons, yet over a decade of trials of two dozen men who all got sentences of multiple decades, shows just how unjust the system is. They are not even classed as political prisoners and are in with the hardened lifetime criminals in maximum security. All are NOT equal before the law. The Foundation has pointed to the fact that Mbatha gave a certain Walter Smiles an instruction on 25 May 1993 to throw a hand grenade into the Trustbank building in Kimberley. He transported Smiles to the scene and was present when the grenade was thrown, which killed one innocent civilian and 41 others, including women and children, were injured. Because this happened long after the government of FW de Klerk decided to hand the country over on a silver platter to the ANC and its polarised black majority, the attack did not serve any political purpose at all, not even from the ANC perspective. Mbatha was the commander of the ANC?s armed terrorist wing Umkhonto we Sizwe in the Northern Cape at the time. Mbatha later applied for amnesty before the Truth and Reconciliation Committee (TRC) but was not granted amnesty. The TRC found that the grenade attack was not done with a political objective that could be regarded as part of the conflict of the past. Murder and attempted murder charges were laid against Mbatha but the National Prosecuting Authority never prosecuted Mbatha, obviously because he is an ANC member. Mr Botha has pointed out that the NPA is falling over its feet to prosecute white ex members of the security forces, who are all very old by now and who all acted with a political objective and on instruction of political heads, yet Mbatha was never prosecuted despite the TRC finding that he did not act with a political objective. Who knows, maybe this is the ANC?s way of making sure he tows the party line. One wrong move and they will bring the murder charges to life again?

"Ramaphosa, ANC & Abdool Karim Want To Flatten the Economy, NOT The Curve, Because The Party & Socialism are More Important Than The Economy! COVID19: Converting Capitalism to Socialism","#CommunistVirus The CoronaVirus presents an existential threat in SA, but to who? After the landmark presentation with Salim Abdool Karim last week, we were left with a feeling that something was not right. Now this is normal whenever it comes to anything to do with the ANC regime, but it is usually quite obvious. As the infection numbers come in everyday I have realised the problem. Karim has inexplicably pegged the return to semi or normal life at a very low, impossible threshold. In fact he says so himself when he admits that we cannot escape the Covid19 epidemic and that the curve will increase. He is right, the CCPvirus is here to stay and like the flu, we will all have to come to terms with it sooner or later. Obviously later, with the benefit of a vaccine would be preferable, but 80% of us will survive just fine without one. Despite this, Salim Abdool Karim set an impossibly low threshold for his exit of the lockdown stage, which was probably just to pretend or offer some hope to motivate people to stay home. If the idea is to flatten the curve, then he would not be setting an impossibly small threshold for returning to normal, as South Africa?s hospitals can quite easily cope with around 100 cases a day, as we have seen over the last few weeks. In fact SA has more beds than UK with a similar population size and look how high their numbers are. The whole point of flattening the curve is to spread the load on hospitals over a longer period, not to try stop it completely. So does Karim want to stop Corona completely, which as he himself admitted is not possible, or does he want to flatten the curve, or has the ANC interfered with his prognosis? The numbers do not add up ? South Africa is the only country in the world whose infection numbers dropped form Day ONE of the lockdown, and even worse, two weeks later when they should have started dropping, they went up! Experts the world over say infections numbers are at least ten times more, so why did Karim peg South Africa?s emergence from Lockdown to such a low number? Clearly they want to keep it in place. Despite all their bravado and virtue signalling, the ANC regime and Ramaphosa are also very, very scared and know they will not cope when the full force of COVID19 hits, this is why they are so strict about it. They have seen all the bad press their Chinese counterparts, The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are getting and it is starting to look like communism itself is facing an existential threat from this virus they started. The level of anti Chinese Communist Party activism inside and outside of China have reach unprecedented levels. mostly in reaction to China?s heavy handed response in trying to suppress news of the outbreak getting out. Likewise, the ANC know how fickle their electorate is, from years of practice of throwing the \""white man bad\"" bone at their Pavlovian voters, they fear that if their voters start associating Socialism with CoronaVirus carnage and a catastrophic outcome for South Africa, ANC will be history. Even worse, if the CCPvirus epidemic brings about a \""night of the long knives\"" scenario into the middle and upper class suburbs, the international ramifications to the ANC money machine, milking altruistic western aid, will be terminal. Like in Rwanda, their days in government will be over. So is it any wonder they are willing to risk the economy, or what is left of it, on the outcome of the epidemic in SA? ban on liquor sales Their refusal to loosen up alcohol and tobacco rules is totalitarian, draconian and ridiculous like a modern day Prohibition, and really distracts from the true purpose of the lockdown. Instead they offer to help these businesses onto welfare dependency by telling them to apply for financial assistance from the government ? converting capitalism to socialism. Sure they do not want any drunken brawls causing hospitals to become swamped again, but it is not that difficult to setup and enforce restrictions and quotas, after all they are good with that. In a seven page long reply, the office of the state attorney said the decision for a national lockdown was not taken lightly and that all trade, \""except truly essential services\"", was halted in an attempt to maximise the effects of the national lockdown and to prevent the virus from \""ravaging\"" South Africans living in the poorest conditions (their voters). If your voters are on the wrong side of the bell curve, are narcissistic, unruly and extremely disobedient, you have to play nanny state, something communists love doing anyway. So, ironically they will have no choice but to use a heavy handed totalitarian approach like the Communist Party of China did. Like we said before, CoronaVirus for the ANC is the gift that never stops giving. This is their big opportunity to cement Socialism into the system and to give Capitalism a big knock. Ramaphosa must be really tired of Rothschild whispering in his ear, telling him what to do! Although like all communists, he seems to have forgotten where the money comes from, but what do you expect from someone who became a billionaire because he is black, and has no qualms in removing private property rights in SA. Not being a drinker or smoker I have no problem with these draconian measures, however it is almost certainly going to promote lawlessness, illicit trade and even resentment, protest, looting and violence. As one person who was arrested for disobeying the lockdown said, \""I would rather die of Corona than of hunger\"" ? When it comes to addictions like alcohol, cigarettes and certainly drugs, this is probably even more true. Unfortunately these are the very people who are more susceptible to the CCPvirus. So it boils down to a world where there is free choice with heavy regulation, or a totalitarian regime that makes, and enforces your choices and lifestyle for you. It should be no surprise the the Marxist ANC and Ramaphosa chose the latter, and it can only mean dark days ahead, much like we saw in China where people were locked into their houses or state controlled properties. As SA-News reported, we saw in Limpopo two junior doctors who were not allowed to self isolate, even though they had asymptomatic Covid19. The provincial legislature even went to court to get an arrest warrant, then the police arrested them and took them to a TB hospital that had been emptied of its TB patients, to accommodate COVID19 patients. Once again, as Karim said, 80% of cases will be mild and will be able to self isolate, so the draconian measures and low thresholds are definitely out of place, which means the ANC want to use COVID19 for other purposes. Indeed, the CoronaVirus carries a silent passenger, another deadly virus called Communism! SA Unique Trajectory SA?s Unique Trajectory is no Coincidence, it is just not real? ",sa-news,0
"India Gets Dodgy PPE Gear Too, What About South Africa? China Putting Lives at Risk as it \""Donates\"" Faulty Medical Gear To Cover up its #CCPVirus Guilt!","Just as the ANC regime make a song and a dance about receiving a batch of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) from China, India joins the long list of countries complaining that they have been duped by China?s altruistic propaganda campaign. India received 50,000 faulty personal protection equipment (PPE) from China. Like South Africa, and many other desperate countries, the gear was part of a charity drive trying to improve China?s image as a global power, promote communism, and also to make up for unleashing CCPvirus on the world, which has now killed nearly 150,000 people. However it is very unlikely the pro China ANC will ever admit to receiving faulty gear from its communist counterpart, China. According to India?s Health Ministry (ICMR), China?s poor quality control has now become a global headache at a time when the world needs help the most. It is almost like pushing someone into the water, then pretending to save them by throwing them a faulty lifebuoy, which sinks. Truly, the only question that remains, is was any of this deliberate? China?s substandard supplies are not welcomed by the latest recipient struggling with COVID19, India, where sources in the Health Ministry have confirmed a report that India has received personal protection equipment (PPE) from China, which failed quality tests. The gear is unsafe and unusable and in fact China?s poor quality control has become a global headache. As SA-News reported earlier, Spain, The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Turkey, Finland, Britain, Netherlands, etc. are among the many countries that have received faulty kits and substandard gear from China. China was counting on this charity drive to repair its image, but if anything, these faulty supplies are only damaging China?s reputation further. The PPE is the body armor for doctors and nurses on the frontlines, whose personal protection equipment or PPE, are gloves, a mask and a gown, which make up one PPE kit. Every doctor treating coronavirus patients needs them. PPE is the shield that protects them against the virus. Like South Africa, India now also needs more of it because faulty equipment is setting back the fight against coronavirus. ANC health minister Zweli Mkhize and others made a big media event out of receiving the PPE from China this week. When the batch landed in SA, SA-News asked Dirco if there were any concerns about this, but we had no reply yet. The list of complaints against faulty medical kits from China is growing. Scientists and health authorities from all these countries received faulty tests and kits for which these government?s reportedly paid millions of dollars to Chinese companies to procure them. Georgia wanted to buy rapid coronavirus tests from China, but they have now suspended their agreement. The Netherlands wants to return 600,000 face masks purchased from China, as the N95 masks did not fit properly and the filters didn?t work. When the Dutch officials demanded a recall, Beijing did not apologize, but instead China blamed the Netherlands! The Chinese foreign ministry said that the Dutch government should read the instructions on the box! China may try to deny and deflect, but the problem is China faces a real struggle when it comes to quality control. Until the 12th of March, Chinese officials seized millions of pieces of faulty equipment which included more than 80 million faulty masks, and 370,000 defective or fake disinfectants. Are these what China sent to the rest of the world as donations? Counterfeiting has not stopped in China either and now Chinese traders are exporting fake faulty equipment to a desperate world. Often the term \""made in China\"" is used as a synonym for defective cheap products, and now the world?s worst affected countries are using the same description for Chinese coronavirus supplies!

"Be Alert! Real Criminals, Chancers & Even Those in Authority Are Taking Advantage of Lockdown & Bheke Celes Distraction With Misdemeanor Crimes!","#TotalitarianTimes Never before has your state of readiness and preparedness been so important. If you have a gun locked in the safe, now is the time to take it out while you are at home during lockdown, just keep it away from bored kids. It is clear that criminals are not obeying the lockdown regulations, and farmers & city dwellers alike are increasingly falling victim to this, even as Police and Armed Forces are also abusing their new totalitarian powers in greater numbers, and are also committing crimes themselves, while Police Minister Cele distracts everyone with CoronaVirus misdemeanors. The joke is that awaiting trial criminals are being released due to COVID19, so the message to criminals is loud and clear? it is open season! According to the Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU SA) there is an apparent increase in theft of agricultural products nationwide, such as crop, feed and livestock theft, while cable theft is also increasing in certain areas and frustrating farmers? production. TAU SA?s Northern Region chairman, Mr. Henk van de Graaf said \""What worries us further is the fact that farm guards and CPFs are explicitly prohibited by the Minister of Police from continuing their normal patrols and crime prevention, while the police are currently focusing on other matters, this means that the rural areas are now unsecured. Criminals know this and are taking advantage of the situation.\"" TAU SA is also concerned about the police?s focus on, among other things, people who want to buy liquor or tobacco products and even persecutes them unreasonably harshly, while there is almost no policing of real thieves who threaten food security. While TAU advises people to increase vigilance on their own farms, the strength of the farm guards system lies precisely in the mutual cooperation and efficient communication in the coverage of larger areas than just their own farm. Public roads, which often allow access and criminals? escape routes are also not being patrolled. These rural areas are now deserted, which of course welcomes the rural thieves because the police and army are too busy with people who disregard the containment measures. However this could explode in the regime?s face due to the brutality with which police and army members treat those caught. This however could be an attempt at a deterrent because police have to employ a catch and release system, ever since Ramaphosa ordered people caught committing misdemeanor crimes, to be released. So the public are not being protected at all. \""After the severe drought and the agricultural industry?s paralysis due to foot-and-mouth disease, farmers can not afford uncontrolled theft of their products because the minister of police is making irrational decisions,\"" said Mr. van de Graaf. \""Farmers are now beginning to see their farms as disaster areas, and are going to institute their own emergency measures against any suspicious entry or movement on the farm,\"" he warns. \""It will not be to the benefit of anyone, and we urge the provincial government to take up the matter urgently with the national government in order to get a quick review of existing assignments in this regard. We can?t go on like this for another three weeks.\"" On too many occasions we have seen police and army members involved in unacceptable brutality with which people are being treated, and now there are serious warnings that the action could endanger the government. If the police brutality is not thoroughly investigated, it could lead to a series of court cases. Observers point out that the actions of army members also show that no training was given, except that the president directed a cautionary word to warn in advance that they should be gentle with offenders. Clearly the ANC policy of using violence to achieve their aims is still deep seated, as the security forces and the regime have apparently not yet reached the point of moving away from the violence they have been clinging to, to deal with perpetrators in the last 25 years. The ANC regime has also not bothered to excise the criminal elements from its ranks, but rather seems to shelter them. The Minister of Police himself was fired for corruption as Police Chief in 2013. So it should be no surprise that at least seven police officers have been arrested and charged for their involvement in a burglary attempt at a liquor store. The police officers were arrested in Bonnievale and appeared in court for a first hearing on Tuesday. National Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed the arrest and said the officers had broken the law and therefore justice would be applied. Like a modern day Prohibition, liquor sales are banned during the lockdown period, and the return of their sale is now being advocated for by a group in the Central Transvaal, which even threatens to approach the court if the government does not lift the ban. In the meantime, it has been established that illegal liquor trading is widely practiced by individuals who break into liquor stores, as befits a Gangster State.",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: What Are The Criteria For Food Parcels? Do Any Poor White People, Families or Groups Get Food Aid? Do They Need to Vote ANC First?","Is \""patronage\"" the new word for buying votes? What are the criteria to qualify for Food Aid? While the ANC claims that specific criteria are being used to identify families to be assisted during the lockdown with food aid, it seems, as usual, that corruption, bribery and indeed anti white racism are the order of the day. According to Gauteng Premier David Makhura, patronage and corruption won?t be tolerated in the distribution of food parcels to the needy, but it seems the horse has already bolted. SANCO has already laid a charge of corruption and we know of food aid going to blacks in Munsieville but not to the white families in the same squatter camp? Tshwane Metro also claim they \""try avoid using state funds for corruption purposes\""! So do they rather use redirected funds like people?s electricity and water payments or private donations and business funding for corruption? How hard do they try? They talk as if corruption is a legitimate business expense? Is there a difference between \""outright corruption\"" and normal corruption? National Civic Organisation (SANCO) has opened a case of corruption against one of its own members and government officials, for distributing food parcels unfairly and favouring certain people. SANCO claims to have proof that these officials delivered food parcels to their own families, friends and political party constituency members, instead of valid beneficiaries and families that desperately need food parcels. If video does not load above see here: https://youtu.be/puMuXukMtpg The SANCO Chairperson in Tshwane, Abram Mashishi said: \""We have opened a case at Silverton police station. We have the reference number and the police are investigating the matter. We opened the case on the following basis, complaints have come through. We don?t want to compromise the investigation, but we know the suspects. One of the suspects is one of our own members. The other one is a government official, who is working at the Social Development Department.\"" Meanwhile, the Tshwane Metro says it is not aware of any such complaints and claims that it supports non-partisanship? but have they given any food aid to poor white people yet?

"Are COVID19 Tests Irrelevant or Faulty? SA the Only Country in the World Where Infections Dropped on Day ONE of Lockdown, Instead of Two Weeks Later!","What happened to the chart two weeks after lockdown? Nothing. It is becoming increasingly clear that far too much attention is being placed on the small daily test results despite them not giving reliable or sufficient test data, which makes forecasting pointless. While this is understandable given the nature of the invisible threat, the ANC regime did have months to prepare & get testing regimens in place. However even Prof. Karim himself said that it takes two weeks for the symptoms to progress and appear, yet in the same breath he echoes Ramaphosa?s bragging that the case numbers fell on the FIRST day of lockdown? Dr. Pillay, head of South Africa?s national health department also pointed to the fact that the people tested positive so far only reflect those people who got infected 2 weeks prior to showing symptoms, and then being tested. How then is it possible for infections to drop on day one of lockdown? Ramaphosa claimed there is \""sufficient evidence\"" to show the lockdown is working, but admitted that it is too early to make a \""definitive analysis of the progression of the disease\"", however they refuse to revealed which datasets, epidemiological modelling, or projections the regime used to make its decision to expand the lockdown. He spoke widely with non scientific parties, including opposition leaders, provincial premiers and representatives of business and labour, but he has not made public what the exact statistics or projections which supported the decision to extend the lockdown from three to five weeks were. Furthermore, despite having months of warning, it is known that the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), that conducts testing on behalf of the ANC regime, is nowhere near close to reaching is target of 36 000 tests per day. According to Dr. Pillay, there are simply not enough test kits and he admitted to Parliamentarians on Friday that the ANC government does not do enough COVID-19 tests to get a true picture of how many COVID-19 infections there are in the country. Yet somehow Ramaphosa claims the lockdown was having an effect from day one? The NHLS also admitted to Rapport on Saturday that the testing kits that they ordered from the USA have not arrived after a full 3 weeks, but they did not want to tell Rapport how many testing kits they ordered or how many they still have in stock. The shortage in testing kits comes amidst a relatively small daily increase in COVID-19 infections, which could be caused by the shortage of testing. Authorities are simply not testing enough people because they don?t have enough testing kits in stock, and there are other known issues with testing kits outlined below. DA leader John Steenhuisen, said the lack of data on the spread of the virus is concerning. \""There?s a complete absence of empirical data or detail about which metrics government will use to measure whether the lockdown is successful or not. They?re not playing open cards with the public.\"" The regime claims that they are testing about 5,000 people daily at the moment and have an army of community workers out in the community, but these workers do not test, they only refer people for testing. So this screening process at the moment will only test people if they show symptoms of COVID-19. This method will bypass people who are COVID-19 positive but who don?t show symptoms yet, although they can still infect other people whilst unaware they have COVID-19. This is why it is important for wider testing to be done with more efficient testing regimens. There could be many more people who have COVID-19 but just don?t know it yet. So any current assessment really reflect the situation 2 weeks ago. The RT-PCR test performed with throat swabs are only reliable in the first week of the disease after which the virus can disappear down the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs. For infected people tested in the second week, alternative sample material should then be taken from the deep airways by suction catheter or coughing up material (sputum) can be used. The samples also need to reach the labs within hours. We know that Jack Ma from Alibaba donated a million testing kits from China to Africa, so how many did South Africa get or did they all go to Ramaphosa?s AU friends? In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits and revised their positive diagnoses definition. As SA-News reported, Spain purchased test kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that results were inaccurate. The firm defended this by blaming Spain for failure to collect samples properly or use the kits correctly. The Spanish returned the kits that gave incorrect results, and would replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy aswell. 80% of test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China also gave wrong results and Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which were also found to be inaccurate. Prime Minister Matovi? suggested these be dumped into the Danube River! Ate? Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the test kits Turkey purchased from China had a \""high error rate\"" and did not \""put them into use.\"" Likewise, the UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced these were not usable. It is almost as if China wants other nations to fail? Prof. Karim also admitted that the virus came from abroad, so at the end of the day, had ANC closed the borders earlier, a lockdown would probably not have been needed. A senior government official present at the decision-making process said on Saturday that Ramaphosa was informed \""by the best brains in the country\"" before he made decisions and that extending the lockdown was based on scientific evidence presented to him. He said the numbers which swayed Ramaphosa were \""scary\"", and added that government did not want to create panic. So unless the bodies start piling up in the next week or two, and if the test results are in fact an accurate reflection, as the government projections claim, then the extended five-week national lockdown could well have succeeded in delaying South Africa?s worst-case Covid-19 scenario to September, when winter and the associated annual flu epidemic will exacerbate things? #WinterCometh?

VIDEO: Ramaphosa Thinks Lockdown is Funny & Jokes He Will Extend it to Next Year April! Meanwhile Mass Civil Disobedience Looms in SA!,"Ramaphosa thinks that lockdown is funny and jokes with some friends on a video call that he meant the lockdown will last till April 16 next year, not this year! Meanwhile many shops have already been looted like this one in the video at Avonwood Spar in Cape Town on the 9th. The Chaplain General of the SA National Defence Force told troops of 21 SA Infantry Battalion that they do not take orders form the SA Police, but are there to support them. This is stange as a Chaplain, why is he even addressing the troops being deployed? Chaplains are not operational personnel and the commanding office should be doing it. The police and army forces have closed down many main roads, like the M1 in Johannesburg in this video, to deal with the people who are not adhering to the lockdown regulations. ",sa-news,0
"W.H.O. Director General Tells The World To Stay Locked Down While China Gets A Headstart in Global Economy! 848,000 Sign Petition for his Resignation!","The embattled Director General of World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been accused by many of being yet another Chinese plant in a globalist organisation, doubled down on his Chinese loyalty by telling nations of the world to stay locked down, yet China is getting back to work and restarting their economy, getting a headstart on the global economy. How convenient for the very country that started the CCPvirus trouble! Meanwhile over 836,000 people have signed a petition asking for Tedros to resign (see chart below detailing his errors)! If you thought the Chinese influence over world organisations like UN & World Health Organisation is a coincidence, think again. It is part of a deliberate plot to gain global domination and to spread communist policies worldwide. This was proven when China put out a letter of \""solidarity\"" to 230 globalist left wing parties calling for \""co-operation on global governance\""! While minimizing the seriousness of the virus for domestic consumption, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) strategy is to massively exaggerate the virus problem internationally. The CCP open letter calls the disease outbreak \""the most urgent and serious challenge\"" in the international arena, but back home the CCP are sending people back to work. Even after Donald Trump called out WHO for its \""china-centric\"" policy, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is unashamedly continuing hostile activities to leverage the virus outbreak, it started, to its own advantage. It sent out the open letter to 230 global far-left political parties calling for \""coordinated policies\"" and \""mobilization of resources and forces globally.\"" Many around the world have already endorsed and echoed the call for an alternative Communist World Order including significant political parties like the ruling Communist Party of Cuba and the Communist Party of Nepal. The South African Communist Party, which semi-governs South Africa in partnership with Mandela?s African National Congress, has endorsed the letter. The ANC also put out their own version of the letter, calling all previously labelled terrorist organisations, now called \""liberation movements\"" in Africa, most of whom are now governing as despots, to band together. The often-ruling and openly communist Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus also signed on. The Communist Party USA, Communist Party of Australia, the Communist Party of Britain, and the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist) have also lent their world supremacist names to the effort. Lesser well-known left wing parties backing the CCP initiative include the Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist), Thailand?s leftist Pheu Thai Party, and the militant Rwandan Patriotic Front. Reports have also been uncovered that the World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom was a member of an Ethiopian Marxist communist political party. The Tigray People?s Liberation Front (TPLF) was previously categorized by the United States State Department as a terrorist organization for alleged crimes against humanity. Tedros?s candidacy for WHO director general was opposed vigorously by several Ethiopian parties, due to his career in the violent Communist Tigray People?s Liberation Front. The TPLF and China provided millions of dollars in financial support for Tedros?s victorious candidacy for general director of WHO. The United States State Department, which is continuing an aggressive push to root out CCP efforts of intellectual property theft in the United States, has previously categorized TPLF as a terrorist organization, stating it?s \""violent activities before it became part of the ruling coalition and the government of Ethiopia in May 1991.\"" The group can be found on TrackTerrorism.org \""The Tigrayan People?s Liberation Front (TPLF) is a political party in Tigray, Ethiopia that has been listed as a perpetrator in the Global Terrorism Database, based on ten incidents occurring between 1976 and 1990 Tedros has also been accused of covering up at least 3 epidemics in his own country when he was Health minister for Ethiopia. So on January 23rd, 2020, when Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declines to declare China virus outbreak as a global health emergency, it was just more of the same for him! As we all know, the Coronavirus is not treatable at the moment. The number of infected and deaths has risen more than ten times with over 1.6 Million infected and over 100,000 deaths! Part of it is related to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus? deliberate under estimation of the coronavirus. The petition calling for the resignation of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General is in half a dozen languages and has been signed from all over the world by people who think Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is not fit for his role as WHO Director General. The call is for the Immediate Resignation of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Many people are really disappointed, as they believed WHO is supposed to be politically neutral, yet without any investigation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus solely believed the death and infected numbers that the Chinese communist government provided them, despite even not being allowed into China in the early days of the then epidemic. Furthermore, Taiwan should not be excluded from WHO for any political reasons. Their technologies are far more advanced than some of the countries on the \""selected WHO list\"". For Dr. Tedros to play the racecard against Taiwan is proof he has no actual argument and is purely trying to use his role to manipulate the world for China?s advantage. ",sa-news,0
Even in Lockdown Blacks Continue To Burn Down & Sabotage Their Own Schools! Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi Blames Syndicates Without Giving a Motive? More Handouts or to Force Black Kids into White Schools Maybe?,"Burning down their own schools has been a stupid part of black political expression for half a century and it is probably a good bet that these perpetrators are members of ANC youth league. It is certainly a trend when a fourth school in Gauteng has gone up in flames just during the lockdown conditions, despite supposed enhanced security conditions by the police and army to keep people in their homes! This brings the total to 22 schools in the province which have now been sabotaged, just in the 12 days of confinement. So what are they trying to achieve politically this time? Maintain their victimhood, tender fraud, or to force more \""underprivileged\"" black kids in white schools, where education is treasured and respected, not used as a political tool? This latest school to have been burnt was Soshanguve High, which was set alight in the early hours of Wednesday. Another school, Amogelang, also in Soshanguve, was set on fire on Tuesday. The fire was started in the administrative part of the school which is in Soshanguve?s residential area. A government spokeswoman claims they do not know what is going on, and requests for security forces to protect the schools have apparently not been successful and observers say the government should order security forces to provide 24-hour protection to all schools in the province. MEC of Education Panyaza Lesufi, well known for his hatred of Afrikaans and white schools, claimed they were dismayed about what is happening, but his reaction seemed almost staged, for an otherwise over confident, sometime aggressively \""know it all\"" ANC official to admit not knowing something, is unusual? \""We really don?t know what is happening in Soshanguve. We are dismayed to report about yet another school destroyed by fire, worse within few days in the same area.\"" \""This is worrisome, it looks like same modus operandi is used. We are tempted to believe that there is a syndicate operating in the area.\"" Lesufi said. Investigators agree the same people may be committing the vandalism because the damage is consistent with all other incidents, Lesufi was set to visit all the torched schools in Soshanguve on Wednesday, which can only mean the burnt schools are part of his political agenda, whatever that may be?

Update: Two COVID19 Positive Doctors Who Were Arrested & Locked in TB Hospital Released! Were Not Seen by a Doctor & Had to Take Own Temperatures!,"The ANC regime in Limpopo emptied a dilapidated TB hospital in Nylstoom to house COVID-19 positive people, but the first 3 people locked up there never even saw a doctor, were given dirty rooms and had to take their own temperatures! Dr Claire Olivier, Dr Taryn Williams and Elmarie van Emmenis (64) were all suddenly released from the ANC Gulag on Wednesday morning less than a week after being locked up there! They were forced into the MDR TB hospital in Nylstoom last Thursday by the Limpopo Department of Health, after testing positive for COVID-19. They were all self isolating at home before they were arrested and forced into the MDR hospital, where they all reported that the rooms that they were kept in were dirty. Van Emmenis said she had to take her temperature herself and a nurse phoned her to get her temperature every time. A doctor also did not come to see her. Van Emmenis was already in self isolation on her farm for a period of 2 weeks before her detention in MDR hospital. She tested positive on 29 March. Hennie Erwee, Mrs Van Emmenis?s lawyer, wrote a letter on Tuesday to Phopi Ramathuba, the MEC for Health in Limpopo, who had said that even if she was Bill Gates, he would have to be kept in a state facility (see on video below)! He demanded that his client must be freed on Wednesday because the State has not provided documents as to why his client should be locked up. The legal representative of Dr Olivier and Dr Williams also handed in opposing arguments at the High Court in Polokwane which had previously granted a court order to allow the Limpopo Health Department and the Police to arrest and detain the 2 doctors. Watch the video of the 2 doctors being arrested and locked up in the hospital: Watch video here if video does not load above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBqEP9G7_uY Serious questions must now be asked as to why and how a High Court could have agreed to this illegal action in the first place. The national emergency regulations does make it possible for people who don?t have serious COVID-19 symptoms to self isolate. It?s only Limpopo which chose such a draconian approach to lock people up against their will. The MDR hospital, a TB hospital, was emptied for COVID-19 patients but after the release of these first 3 patients, is empty again.

"Apartheid 2.0  Black Supremacist ANC Implements Racist Criteria for Government COVID-19 Assistance, Despite Calling it Fake News! DA & Afriforum Will Fight This Race Based Aid!","The ANC regime has announced a racial framework for government COVID-19 assistance, the possibly of which they previously called fake news! The DA and Afriforum say they will fight against these BEE based measures, after two State departments have come out with a strict racial classification to determine which lucky South Africans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will get financial assistance. Now that the facts are on the table and the DA and Afriforum have come out strongly against these measures, which are intended to, as usual, discriminate against white South African employers and employees, who actually employ a lot of black South Africans. Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, the minister of Tourism, has released a statement this week stating that assistance to small, medium and micro businesses in the tourism sector will be determined by the ANC?s racist BBBEE policies and black supremacist \""economic transformation\"", which is code for the fact that only black people will be helped. The department of Agriculture has also brought out a statement encouraging only black, coloured and Indian small-scale farmers to apply for financial assistance from the department. John Steenhuisen, the DA leader, says the measures announced by these 2 departments will only encourage more divisions in a time that people are supposed to be standing together in the fight against a deadly pandemic. Steenhuisen also said that the DA was inundated the last 2 weeks by white people who were unhappy about the fact that they can?t apply for COVID-19 related assistance on the basis of their skin colour. Kallie Kriel of Afriforum has said that Afriforum will oppose any measure implemented by the government that are based on race which excludes assistance to white people, in court. The ANC can expect a big fight and risk being exposed even more for the black supremacists they are. ",sa-news,0
"Trump Calls Out World Health Organisation (WHO) for Their \""China-centricity\"" and for Calling Every Shot Wrong on COVID19 Chinese Virus!","In a long overdue commentary, US President Donald Trump has threatened to hold back funding to the embattled World Health Organization, leaving the struggling globalist organisation without the slush fund from its largest donor, as many of its 194 members are currently being ravaged by the coronavirus. Will China, who has largely seemed to be calling all the shots at WHO, and has allegedly recovered, step in and take up the slack, even as the WHO demands that the world must show China \""gratitude & respect\""? During his daily briefing on the coronavirus situation on Tuesday, Trump unleashed an attack, this time at the WHO, saying that the organization he dubbed \""China-centric\"" was too slow and ineffective in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said \""The World Health Organization receives vast amounts of money from the United States, we pay the biggest portion of their money,\"" Trump said, pointing out that the struggling organization had \""called every shot wrong\"" on the Covid-19 crisis. \""They could have called it months earlier ? they should have known, and they probably did know. ? We?re going to put a hold on money spent with the WHO, put a very powerful hold on it.\"" When Trump was asked about suspending funding to the organization, which is supposed to be the key international body fighting coronavirus, but is not, Trump said \""I?m not saying I?m going to do it, I?m going to look at it ? We will look at ending funding.\"" The embattled global health organisation has recently become a target of many including the US president?s wrath. Tweeting ahead of the presser, Trump took aim at the WHO for its opposition to sweeping travel bans early on in the pandemic. He and other world leaders have repeatedly accused the WHO of corruption and being biased in favor of Beijing. Stories of China building an African Center for Disease control in the Secretary General?s home country are one of many doing the rounds. Like many other global organisations, the US is the WHO?s largest financial contributor, paying $57.8 million so far this year alone, according to the organization. China is the next biggest donor, giving only half that, $28.7 million in the same period. The WHO has faced severe criticism for dragging its feet on the global health crisis allowing China to put the world at risk. Back in February, its director Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that there was no need to introduce travel bans, while describing the spread of the virus outside mainland China as \""minimal and slow.\"" Boy was he wrong! There is a petition for Dr Tedros to resign: https://www.change.org/p/united-nations-call-for-the-resignation-of-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus-who-director-general The petition reads: On January 23rd, 2020.

"\""Say You Want to Kill Off 95% of The World\""  News24 Spreads Fake News, Panic & Conspiracy Theories (Again) About CoronaVirus Vaccine & Bill Gates in Africa  Adriaan Basson Forced To Apologise!","For all those dedicated yet misled subscribers and supporters of mainstream media who think their favourite daily news platform is never wrong, here is a whopper! News24 (NASPERS) even issued an apology to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for their fake \""Africa vaccine\"" story on 2020-04-05 at 22:22 ? But this was not the first time they deliberately spread virus panic and fear, using words like \""Say You Want to Kill Off 95% of The World Population?\"" in their main Corona Virus news coverage! On Saturday, 4 April, News24 published an article using the inflammatory headline \""Bill Gates confident a potential coronavirus vaccine will work in Africa, but Twitter does not think so\"". It seems NEWS24 do not know the difference between a testing kit and a vaccine, because it was testing kits that Bill Gates discussed with Ramaphosa, according to Ramaphosa?s tweet, which this story was based on. NEWS24 admit they used a social media tweet from Cyril Ramaphosa?s Twitter account, about support from the oligarch Bill Gates for South Africa?s health needs, as the basis for their wild conspiracy theory about the richest man in the world testing vaccines on poor downtrodden Africans. Embedded in Ramaphosa?s tweet was an excerpt from an interview by the far left wing activist Trevor Noah with Bill Gates, (gotta keep that white guilt flowing you know), during which Gates details his support of efforts to fight Covid-19 as quickly as possible. However this in itself is fake news as there is no way whatsoever that SA will get sufficient testing equipment in time, so Ramaphosa is just once again telling people what they want to hear. Bill Gates Ramaphosa NEWS24 also admit that nowhere in the interview does Bill Gates mention testing a vaccine in Africa and also admit in their apology that in his tweet, Ramaphosa stated that Bill Gates will support South Africa with testing kits and research. Clearly the NEWS24 headline was a fabrication and not supported by the substance of the story whatsoever and was pure sensationalism and conspiracy theorizing. Even though News24 removed the article as soon as it was brought to their attention, one must wonder how the hell did this happen in a multinational corporation with so many staff on such huge salaries? Should News24 be allowed to get away with just an apology? News24 apology Interestingly, News24 unreservedly apologised to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and their own readers for any harm caused by the publication of this false story, but no apology to Ramaphosa? As we know their only interest is money and sales. In fact two days later Naspers announced the completion of a share buyback of their own shares, when shares are at a historic low, netting themselves a whopping R3.3 Billion as the internet giant (Naspers) completed the R22.4 Billion share buyback programme on March 24th. Over nine million Naspers N ordinary shares were bought back. \""This is a sad ending to a phenomenal week for our great team, who have worked tirelessly to tell the devastating story of Covid-19 to our readers. I am deeply embarrassed by this mistake and apologise to Mr Gates for any harm caused. We will learn from this episode and move forward,\"" the left wing News24 editor-in-chief / spin doctor, Adriaan Basson said. He claims he will request an investigation by the publication?s public editor, Professor George Claassen, to establish where system lapses took place and how to fix them, however it seems as if there is something fundamentally wrong with the way they create \""news\"", as this is not the first time they have indulged in fear mongering and sowing virus related panic. Previously, in their efforts to \""work tirelessly to tell the devastating story of Covid-19?, on the top of the homepage of their main coronavirus coverage, they featured a FICTIONAL story called Fever, of a pandemic raging through the world killing millions!

"Despite Six Billion in COVID19 Fund ANC Does Not Test More, Yet Over 40% of People Can Have CoronaVirus Without Symptoms, but Government Only Tests Symptomatic Patients or those with Travel History?","As South Africa?s number of officially infected people creeps up very slowly (if we can trust the official figures), relative to other nations, with the number of new infections increasing only by 70 since Saturday to 1,655 with eleven deaths, it highlights that this number is only dependent on the amount of tests being done. Less tests, less patients. Scientists have also found that many people, close to 40% or more, who have contracted the coronavirus have no symptoms, so unless you test widely, you cannot know the true extent of the disease. Tests done on humans on one of the infected cruise ships brought to light the astonishing phenomenon, after a large number tested positive, even though the patients had no symptoms and were even unaware that infection had occurred. SA-News reported and warned about this weeks ago! This might sound like a good thing but it also has a serious disadvantage. Such a patient does not feel ill and will carry on as normal and may unconsciously infect other people, especially those who are vulnerable. Doctors recommend that people placed under a restriction by the government of their country, should apply it strictly to prevent dissemination of the virus. The small village of Vò in northern Italy, where the country?s first death occurred, has already tested 3,000 residents, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms, and almost half of those who did test positive were without any symptoms. The Minister of Health has confirmed that more than 50,000 people have already been tested in black residential areas, and that only 42 new cases have been recorded since Thursday. He did not say what qualifies people for testing. He says the latest two deaths are an 80-year-old man and an 81-year-old Natal woman who died in hospital, and 45 people have already recovered after infection. The minister also added that the government is considering further steps and would like to extend the testing of people to limit the spread. With the billions that has been received, one wonders why this has not been done already? The so called COVID19 relief fund which received R2 Billion in its first week, has since received more and now stands at a total of R6 billion with The State Treasury making a paltry R150 million available, but it also made some concessions to support workers financially. The Oppenheimer family contributed R2 billion, and Johann Rupert himself donated R1 billion, while one black billionaire family also eventually contributed R1 Billion after some media pressure. However, even though these amounts are praiseworthy, they are pointless if the money is not spent effectively, and quickly, like using it to fund a large testing regimen otherwise the virus will continue its silent invisible march?

"VIDEO: Two SA Doctors with Asymptomatic COVID19 Not Allowed to Self Quarantine, Arrested & Forced Into Tuberculosis Hospital by Police!","#COVID19SouthAfrica State Sponsored #COVID19 kidnappings have begun in SA where the ANC are exerting their extra totalitarian powers afforded to them by the State of Disaster & Lockdown. Like happened in communist China, two white female doctors who tested positive for COVID19 but were asymptomatic, have been arrested, after a court order was obtained, at their house and forced into quarantine at a Limpopo multi-drug resistant tuberculosis hospital. The guidelines say that if you?re positive but are asymptomatic or have mild disease, you can be quarantined at home which is what they were doing. However Vavi and other political leaders who are also COVID19 positive have not been treated this way? They had previously been refused COVID19 testing as they had no travel history and were also forced to work without sufficient protective medical clothing. Chairperson of the South African Medical Association (SAMA), Angelique Coetzee has written a strong open letter to the MEC for Health in Limpopo expressing their concern. Dr Williams had flu like symptoms since 23 March but she was told by superiors to work on and was not tested until 29 March. She was first told by her superiors that she would not be tested because she did not travel overseas and was not in contact with anyone who did. Drs Olivier and Williams who worked work at Mmametlhake Hospital in Mpumalanga, but lived in Limpopo informed the South African Medical Association that they were also not allowed to have patients tested for COVID-19 ? even if they showed flu like symptoms, if the patients did not travel overseas or were in contact with someone who did. Something SA-News had said a month ago was a mistake. The doctors told SAMA that they were told by superiors to send people home from hospital with medication for flu and cold, even when they possibly had COVID-19. The doctors said as a result of the Health Department not allowing them to be tested earlier, they are unsure when exactly they contracted COVID-19. Dr Olivier spoke to Dr Phopi Ramathuba, MEC for Health in Limpopo, (recording in video), on the phone, explaining that although they are positive for COVID-19, they are not sick and are self isolating. Dr Ramathuba said to her that it won?t matter if she is Bill Gates, if someone tests positive for COVID-19 in Limpopo, the person will be quarantined at a state hospital. Watch video here if it does not load above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBqEP9G7_uY It also looks like the atrocious treatment of these 2 young state doctors is just the tip of the iceberg and that all hospitals in South Africa were caught unawares by this virus, with no proper protocol in place to safeguard doctors, nurses and the public against the spread of the virus on hospital premises. Young state doctors, many in their first community service year ? that is their first year after university ? say they are working without protective equipment. Unions in the health sector say the same thing. This is not an attempt to be alarmist if one considers what happened at the private St. Augustines hospital in Durban. St Augustine?s emergency room was already closed because of widespread COVID-19 infection and all hospitals could very well shortly be infected and render most doctors, nurses and patients there sick. Three people died within 72 hours in the Netcare St Augustine hospital from COVID-19. According to the CEO of the Netcare group, Dr Richard Friedland, not one of the three showed any symptoms of COVID-19 when they were admitted. They also did not travel overseas or were in contact with anybody who tested positive for COVID-19. The doctor did not mention that the patients could have gotten COVID-19 in the hospital itself. It was also reported that 11 Healthcare workers at the hospital tested positive for COVID-19. This total lack of preparedness and a strategy against COVID-19 could very well develop into a tragic situation in the coming 2 weeks if something is not urgently done, however given the ANC?s obsession with plundering the state coffers and anti white racism, the state is simply not in a position to cope with any disaster, no matter how much money is thrown at the problem?.

"First Week of #CCPvirus Lockdown Was the Easy One. Disregard for Lockdown Regulations, Mass Testing, Infections in Khayalitsha & Alexandra Spell Trouble in Week Two","As the global CoronaVirus infections shoots past 1 Million with over 53,000 dead, the ANC government has announced new measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in SA, by launching a mass campaign of testing people. On the same day the Department of Health admitted that the first official coronavirus infection has been found in Alexandra township next to Johannesburg. This was only a day after the first infection was found in the sprawling black shantytown of Khayalitsha, causing concerns among ANC politicians that it could lead to a very chaotic state. Mimicking their counterparts in China, the ANC initially denied that an infection case had been reported in Alexandra, but admitted yesterday afternoon that a case had in fact been reported. Was this because Alexandra is one of the squatter camps where residents believed the virus does not affect blacks, and therefore they believed is was not necessary to comply with the restriction regulations? Did the ANC also think black people did not get infected or did they just want to enforce their propaganda that it was \""a white man?s thing from the north\"", in order to save the image of the \""Supreme Leader\"" of China where the virus originated from, hence the name CCPvirus. Even locals and activists in China are calling it the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus, because it was the CCP that tried to suppress it and hide it way back in November already, taking away the time and opportunity for the world to prepare. So, have the ANC announced ANY cases of the virus coming from China or is that all called \""travel history pending\""? Ramaphosa said that people with symptoms are referred to clinics or in some cases to mobile clinics where they will be tested, and people with infection who do not have severe symptoms will be kept in their homes, or in isolation as may be provided by the government. ANC official?s family members with guesthouses lining up already for hefty leases? However, patients with severe symptoms will be transferred to hospitals for further treatment. He also said the far reaching use of mobile phone technology and a special tracking system are also being deployed. The regime can go back on cellphone history till March 5th to track people?s movements. The ANC government is also planning a mass testing system with 10,000 workers that could mean moving from house to house in some areas, but experts do not think it applies to white residential areas, where fences and heavy security measures against thieves and robbers are such that access is not easy or possible. As we enter the second week of lockdown restrictions, the closure that came into force last Friday is apparently being ignored by many people in the black neighborhoods, forcing police to take strict action. Police Minister Bheki Cele, who is rather inconsistent in his approach to abiding by the strict measures put in place, says more than 2,000 people have already been arrested by police for disregarding South Africa?s containment order. However according to the government bill on clemency, they will no doubt be released straight away, along with all other awaiting trial prisoners, making a mockery of it all! Even worse was reports that leaders in the police force instructed police stations NOT to accept hand sanitiser that the VF+ Party was donating to them! Payment of pensions has also complicated the matter for the police, especially as the Minister of Transport has made concessions that taxi vehicles can move freely during the whole week for the benefit of pensioners. Keeping their 15 Million voters on grants is paramount to the ANC?s existence. All this does not bode well as infections start popping up and being uncovered by the mass testing, because the infections are there. In the days prior to the lockdown, everyone ran out to the shops and stood in queues, literally spreading the virus far and wide in one go? Batten down the hatches as they say, and stock up on some tonic water, as it would seem the ANC?s main defense approach to the CCPvirus is communist tactics and totalitarian enforcement and policing.

ANC Uses CCPvirus Lockdown as Excuse To Get its Buddies Out of Jail! Western Cape Magistrate Daniel Thulare Even Lets Murder Suspects Free!,"The Corona Virus is the gift that keeps giving for the ANC. Not only has lockdown provided them with new totalitarian powers and loads of extra cash, but the Covid-19 virus just gave the ANC an opportunity to let their voters, criminal friends, family and insurgent operatives out of jail on a large scale. This after Ramaphosa pardoned so many of them in the New Year! Criminals currently being detained in prisons will be released on warning in terms of emergency regulations published in the Government Gazette on Tuesday. Clearly Law and Order and Social Cohesion is not high on the ANC agenda, but then that is not something you would expect from communists. These regulations are for all prisoners who are in prison on a R5,000 or less bail that has been set by the court, but who could not pay the bail. However confusion has erupted, or has been deliberately created to obfuscate responsibility, if the ANC?s cynical history is anything to go by, over the government?s plan to release prisoners amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Although regulations issued by the Justice ministry in the Government Gazette say that ONLY perpetrators of smaller and non violent crimes should be released, netwerk24 reports that Western Cape Chief Magistrate Daniel Thulare has issued an instruction that ALL prisoners, for who bail has been set to R 5,000 or less, but could not afford to pay it, should be released from prisons in courts, under HIS jurisdiction. Thulare?s office has issued a list of names of prisoners who should be released and Court officials told Netwerk24 that most of the prisoners on Thulare?s list are suspects in cases where serious violence is involved, like cases of murder and attempted murder! They will now be released on a warning and given a date on which they should appear again (which is most unlikely, hence the reason for bail in the first place!) Police and prosecutors are also given instructions by the Justice department to fix bail for criminals who are going to be arrested henceforth during the lockdown. So we are going to sit with a lot more criminals on the streets. It also means that not only will police have to re-arrest all these now realeased, that do not appear back for their court set date, but the Police will also have to release anyone they arrest going forward in terms of the lockdown regulations. A true catch and release strategy, and also a signal to criminals that it is open season! Will these criminals be sent to jail if the are caught disobeying the lockdown regulations? Now the ANC will let all their friends and voters out of the jails and claim it is to fight the spread of COVID-19! So that they can commit crimes against law abiding people again? It is quite clear who the ANC?s voter base is. On what scientific rationale will people be released from prisons? Has there been any COVID-19 cases in prisons? Who says the same prisoners won?t get COVID-19 outside? Or that they will transfer the virus to their communities if they already have it? It just seems like a way for the ANC to free criminals for no reason that makes any sense. Very little that the ANC does makes any sense except that somewhere along the line is bribery, corruption and someone sucking the taxpayer dry, making money out of the situation. Like the freeloading University \""students\"" who were on their way home in buses to the Eastern Cape, when the lockdown started. They had to stop right there and then, hire an entire guesthouse and are still there, despite protests from locals, living it up on our tab? is driving home not a valid reason to be out?

"VIDEO: Your Phone is Now an ANC Spy! Ramaphosa Says ANC Will Use YOUR Cellphone To Track You & Possibly Force You Into Quarantine, Like Communist China Did!","Your phone is now an ANC spy! No, this is NOT an April Fools joke. It might be best to leave your phone at home so it does not betray you to the new ANC police state. Ramaphosa announced during his address to the nation that they will sweep aside your rights to privacy, like they did with private property rights, when they use your cellphone data which they could get from the cellphone towers and ISP?s, to track and triangulate your movements to see where you have been and when you were there! Funny they cannot do it to trace criminals to a crime scene? THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT COMMUNIST CHINA DID! The Chinese Communist regime uses people?s cellphone data, APPS & QR codes to decide whether your travel history puts you at risk and liable to be quarantined ? and the people themselves had to pay for the Quarantine! Ramaphosa said \""A large scale screening drive will be undertaken by 10,000 workers who will be deployed to the homes to screen people.\"" \""Using mobile technology, an extensive tracing system will be rapidly deployed, to trace those who have been in contact with confirmed CoronaVirus cases, and to monitor the geographical location of new cases in real time. This drive is far reaching, it is intensive and it is unprecedented in scale...\"" Be very afraid. The Chinese government has increasingly been using CCTV, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence to study citizens? behaviour ? their hopes, fears and faces. This is now coming to South Africa! CoronaVirus is a godsend to Cyril and the totalitarian cadres in the ANC and their SACP cabinet ministers! Are we sure it is just facemasks and goggles that NASPERS is buying from China for R 1 Billion? Remember NASPERS (News24) has previously given over customer data to Chinese authorities from its Tencent platform in China ? some of the people whose data was handed over, have never been seen again! Already 2,000 people have been arrested across the country for non-compliance with the lock-down regulations since Friday. Are draconian measures by law enforcement officials necessary to ensure that lock-down regulations are adhered and enforced? Four people who swore at Bheki Cele on a video were detained! And it is not about to end anytime soon! Cyril said it himself on his Twitter: \""It is now abundantly clear that the most effective way for a society to contain the spread of the disease is for the population to remain at home and physically isolated from each other FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL WEEKS\""!

"As Desperate European Nations Return Defective Medical Gear To China, NASPERS Partners With Communist China to \""Donate\"" a R 1 Billion Tax Break for its Tencent Business in China, To Buy Chinese Made Medical Gear For SAs COVID19 Fight!","The Profiteering & Propaganda opportunities created by the CoronaVirus catastrophe seem endless for the Chinese Communist Regime and its sympathisers like NASPERS, ANC, Jack Ma, etc. who are not letting a good crisis go to waste! Having shut its own borders preventing anyone from coming in, China is now happy to play godfather to a world struggling with the ravages of their Chinese virus. China are exporting anything from the virus itself, to masses of cheap low quality, defective medical goods and gear with heaps of propaganda. Like a virtual Commie love-fest, Ramaphosa announced during his address to the nation, that NASPERS, China?s china, had \""donated\"" R1.5 Billion to help Communist China, erm sorry, for the Corona Relief Fund in SA, however the Naspers group will contribute only R500 Million to the Corona Relief Fund, announced by the President last week. Naspers and its Tencent Business in China, in partnership with the Chinese Communist government will buy R 1 Billion worth of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies from China, just like the ones Europe are returning, to help China in its massive global PR operation, to cover up its non compliance in not warning the world about the virus, and of course also to support South Africa?s health workers when they eventually fly the equipment to South Africa. Meanwhile, the South African National Defense Force has already received a donation of medical protective gear from China?s Armed Forces. The donation includes 2,000 protective goggles, and 30,000 face masks and was reported loudly and proudly on the official Chinese Government TV channel. They also claimed Chinese companies in South Africa have donated R 3 Million rand towards the fight. Interestingly the Chinese State run channel also characterize the relationship between South Africa and China has having developed from a partnership, to a strategic partnership (the Zuma era), to now, being a \""comprehensive strategic partnership\"". Yes, Ramaphosa too is a marxist. What is next? Will South Africa become a protectorate or province of Communist China? Beijing also had to fight off a statement from a French government minister, who said that China ? through its supply of medical equipment and workers ? was using the pandemic as a means to win favor with the international community. In response the Chinese Foreign Ministry had claimed China was playing its part in the global fight against the COVID-19, even though they contravened International Health Regulations by suppressing information about the virus back in November already, when they arrested all the taxis drivers who were talking about it. As part of the World Health Organisation they are compelled to notify other member countries in time, they did not, but chose instead to suppress it, as a result multiple law suits have been lodged against China. Spain, Turkey, Ukraine and the Czech Republic are now returning made-in-china testing kits which a resurgent China is exporting to desperate nations hit by its virus. Medical equipment and testing kits being exported around the world, that were paid for, but claimed as being goodwill gestures, but these Chinese kits were found to be of substandard quality, not meeting basic compliance requirements. The Netherlands has also recalled tens of thousands of masks they had bought from China. Dutch officials say these masks do not meet quality standards. As Spain?s death toll nears 8,000, more than double what China?s was, the Chinese embassy in Madrid defended itself again on Thursday (26 March) from the accusation that the Spanish government had bought a batch of faulty COVID-19 testing kits, blaming it on a convenient \""unauthorised\"" Chinese company. Is such a thing even possible in Communist China where your cellphone tells Party officials whether you might have the virus or not and where you travelled? Even the Leader of the Brexit Party in UK, Nigel Farage said \""China is acting like the charitable godfather, dishing out money, medical equipment and trying to use this crisis to gain global power\"". \""When Germany refused to export medical masks to Italy, despite the desperate state they were in, guess who stepped in ? the people who caused it ? the Chinese,\"" Mr Farage told Sky News, adding that \""I wouldn?t want to see the idiots in Brussels replaced by Chinese communism dominating the world even more than it does today\"". China is also using the opportunities created by its virus to profiteer and extend its Belt and Road plans to build a ?Health Silk Road? where Chinese companies would sell Coronavirus medical supplies to the worst hit countries. The coronavirus crisis is a big business opportunity for China! Meanwhile as the world grapples with the coronavirus crisis, countries like Spain, the second worst affected country in the world in terms of deaths, acted in desperation. Just days ago a Spanish government spokesperson Maria Montero said the country fought \""a war while procuring medical supplies in an overheated Chinese market, but the testing kits purchased from a Chinese firm were faulty.\"" These kits could detect only 30 percent of the cases. Just a day earlier the Spanish government had placed a 475 million dollar order for emergency medical equipment from China and now there is uncertainty over that deal. The testing kits sent to the Czech Republic were even worse ? 80% of the rapid test kits sourced from China were faulty! For these desperate countries it may have been bad business in usual times, but amid the outbreak it proved to be disastrous. Yet countries desperate to cope with the Chinese virus, are lining up to receive help from China! China is supplying over 10,000 testing kits to Africa as the corona virus cases rise across the continent. Poland too will be receiving more than 10,000 kits along with protective gear and masks. China has handed over a hundred thousand testing kits to the Philippines and there another communist sympathiser, the Philippine Foreign Secretary was singing the praises for China?s tremendous \""help\"". China has also sent medical teams to several countries including Serbia and Italy where China has sent three teams so far in total. China is said to have extended its so-called generosity to 89 countries and four international organizations. Playing this role of a savior could help the Asian giant absolve itself of any blame for the deadly outbreak it unleashed upon the world. The Chinese state media too is hard at work to kill the negative publicity, saying there is no place for a smearing game over the products made in China. Good PR for its products is necessary because as China has come to realize in recent decades, exports are profitable profits but during a pandemic though, it does not sound morally right does it? There is a saying about communism, that they will break your leg, then offer you a crutch to show you how caring they are? China however is fast moving towards normalcy while the rest of the world is in dire straights. In China restrictions are being lifted, business has resumed, yet the most advanced countries in the world do not have enough protective gear, not enough masks, not enough ventilators, etc. but China has loads and it?s cashing in on this shortage by flooding them with these medical aids. Ninety percent of large Chinese firms are back at work, but not without government help. Like most countries, China too has announced a large relief package to revive the economy and they communicated the figure of 344 Billion US dollars in terms of mainly fiscal measures. Like the tax break to NASPERS? While major countries are still struggling, China has a head start and can bounce back quickly by boosting business, and what is the world is in need of right now? Personal protective equipment and masks are in short supply, and guess who is filling the gap? Chinese companies. According to a report almost 9,000 new manufacturers started producing masks in China this year. China?s daily mass production has crossed one hundred and fifteen million masks per day! Companies making the most of the situation are BYD, a company that normally makes electric cars, which claims it could make five million masks per day. Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that makes iPhone says it can make two million masks per day. Chinese firms are helping the government win the PR battle. The New York Governor, another sympathiser, Andrew Cuomo thanked Huawei for donations, yet they are the Chinese company that the US government blacklisted due to security reasons. The coronavirus may have turned into a nightmare for the world, but for China, this homegrown disaster has now turned into a mega opportunity to act like a crisis manager for beleaguered nations, an opportunity to trumpet it?s alleged success and make the most of it. China may be selling tens of thousands of test kits to virus hit nations, but they are substandard and defective. The Spanish government fell for these \""humanitarian gestures\"" and now it is feeling sorry for what it did ? 9,000 of the coronavirus test kits that Spain bought from China have turned out to be faulty. 70,000 of the tests conducted using these kits produced wrong results! The outcome is Spain has become the third worst hit country with more than 85,000 active cases and more than 7,700 deaths! Turkey has very similar concerns. The Turkish government says the testing kits they had bought from a Chinese company do not meet their effectiveness standards. The Czech Republic bought 150,000 rapid test kits but only 30,000 have turned out to be effective. This is a long list and many nations are paying a heavy price for doing business with China. It is like a double blow, you get the virus from China, then ask them for help with it and get hit in the guts again! The bottom line is that one must look past the propaganda and not rely on made-in-china products, especially not for a crisis created by China itself, you never know what you?re paying for? well unless you are NASPERS or Jack Ma?

"VIDEO: \""CoronaVirus Does Not Kill Black People\""  Soweto Civil Rights Group HBR Takes Ramaphosa To Court Over #COVID19 #Lockdown","While \""BlackTwitter\"" as it is known in South Africa, have been spreading the myth that blacks cannot get CoronaVirus for weeks, it seems this misinformation has seriously taken hold amongst the black majority! This is probably the reason Ramaphosa had to rope in the army to enforce the lockdown. A civil society group from Soweto called the Hola Bon Renaissance (HBR) Foundation, has taken Cyril Ramaphosa to the Constitutional Court over the 21-day lockdown in SA! The lockdown was implemented at midnight on Thursday 26 March and prevents people from leaving their homes for anything other than essential services in an attempt to control the spread of the coronavirus. Watch video here if it does not load: https://youtu.be/wb7SnSiuyCc According to an article by the Sunday Times, the HBR group argues the lockdown is unconstitutional and that the COVID-19 virus \""poses no serious threat to the country and its people\"". \""HBR Foundation believes that COVID-19 cannot be harmful to Africans,\"" the foundation said. HBR?s argument is based on spurious reports which incorrectly state some people are resistant to COVID-19 based on criteria such as country of origin. However the COVID-19 corona virus is potentially dangerous to all people ? it is a global pandemic which has spread to almost every country around the world.

#WinterCometh COVID-19 aka CCPvirus Far More Widespread Than ANC Stats Claim & Could Require Longer or Second #Lockdown in Winter!,"WILL CCP VIRUS KILL ANC VIRUS? While the West, with its liberal indulgence & open borders is currently being punished very hard for this \""progressiveness\"", as SA-News predicted a few weeks ago, China would be the best case scenario for the CCPvirus, because China is a technological yet totalitarian controlled society and the outside world can only guess at the true figure of infections & deaths in a country with 1.4 Billion people, which is about the same as the whole of Africa! As we predicted, the CCPvirus is likely about to wreak absolute havoc in Africa, and the very thin layer of ANC control is about to be exposed, revealing the fact that their influence over their people, is only as thin as the paper money they use to bribe and buy votes with grants. It is almost certain South Africa will never be the same again after this coming winter. The fundamental thing South Africans are about to learn though, is whether the ANC will resort to hardline totalitarian communist tactics, like their Chinese Communist Party (CCP) counterparts did in China, to control the outbreak, or will they too become a victim? The fact that not a single imported case of CCPvirus from China has been reported, suggests the worst? \""pending travel history\"" seems to be the new name for China? The strange celebrations from ANC cadres on the eve of the lockdown, also hints at the coming totalitarianism in South Africa, using the virus as an excuse. The famous saying about communists rings true, they will break your leg then offer you a crutch so that you are grateful and indebted to them. The question still remains whether the ANC are actually capable of implementing a communist regime? There have already been reports of a man beaten to death in Kenya because the mob thought he had the Chinese virus, even though he was only drunk! When dealing with a primitive society like the majority in South Africa, lockdown is absolutely unavoidable and an extension of the existing lockdown (likely in the midst of a catastrophic infection rate) or second a one might even be needed as #WinterCometh. The absolute necessity of lockdown was also echoed by Rowan Burger, who is an actuary and strategic planner for Momentum Investments who spoke to Rapport. According to Burger, up to 9,000 people in South Africa may already have COVID-19 but because of the incubation period of 2 weeks, may not know they have it because they show no symptoms yet. All of them will in the meantime infect other people, so a lockdown to restrict movement is at this stage is inevitable. SA-News believes it is far more than that but most people do not have the R1,800 to pay for a test and many just think it is a bad bout of flu.The ANC will also follow the communist copy book from China and not be forthcoming with the true figures. Just over 1,200 have officially tested positive for the Chinese virus so far in South Africa, and Burger says his calculations show why the positive infection rate is doubling every 3 days in South Africa. Burger says according to his calculations, up to 200,000 people will die from the Chinese virus if there was no lockdown. Burger says his calculation of 200,000 deaths ? in the case of no lockdown ? factored in that people would take more precautions to prevent the spread of the virus like washing hands and isolating more voluntarily. A lockdown forces people to take the deadly threat seriously. Burger says the reason that the Chinese virus is so dangerous is that many people in South Africa are not healthy and have poor diets. Many people have existing conditions like HIV, TB, high blood pressure and diabetes. Pneumonia and Leukemia are two more risk categories. Their risk of dying from the Chinese virus is bigger. As Burger also points out, this is exacerbated by the fact that South Africa does not have enough hospital beds to accommodate everyone that would become sick without a strict lockdown. This is true even under normal circumstances! Burger suggests the reason that many people who have contracted COVID-19 so far are not critically ill is because we are still in summer and that winter conditions and the accompanying influenza would make the Chinese virus far more deadly. Burger says if the current lockdown is not successful enough, it could make another lockdown unavoidable in June or July of this year. You might be asking why it is being called the CCPvirus? The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in China has done its level best to deny that the virus started in China, and even pulled the racecard when people were calling it the ChineseVirus, They even tried to claim it came from USA! As a result of this global cover up, many activists in China itself, some of whom have disappeared) started calling it the CCPvirus because at the end of the day, the responsibility for this scourge lies with the Chinese Communist Party, who tried to hide the virus in its early days (November last year), instead of warning the rest of the world. Indeed there are now a few lawsuits against China for this very reason. ",sa-news,0
"Elderly Woman Brutally Raped & Tortured with Blowtorch in one of 2 Attacks on Farmers Within Two Hours, On Eve of Lockdown in Mpumalanga. Nothing in Mainstream Media","While ANC cadres were inexplicably singing and dancing, supposedly looking forward to their new lockdown powers, a horrific and shocking attack took place on an elderly woman on the Rainbow Lodge farm in Groenvlei, Belfast on Thursday evening, 26 March at around 20:00. While this was not reported in mainstream media, SA-NEWS is in possession of the name of the farmer who is this lady?s husband and we have the SAPS case number, but can?t publish the name since the lady was brutally raped with an object in addition to being tortured with a blowtorch. This farm attack happened less than 2 hours after another attack on an elderly farmer in the Lothair area near Ermelo in Mpumalanga, in which the farmer was shot in the upper leg which caused his femur bone to be broken. At around 20:00 on the evening of the lockdown, the suspects, 3 black males, took two workers from their house on the Rainbow Lodge farm at Belfast, Mpumalanga to the main building, where the owner and manager stay. All the people in the building were tied up in one bedroom and tied to each other. The attackers demanded money and tortured the farm owner?s wife by burning her with a blowtorch on her chest, and forcing an object in her private parts. They ransacked the house and left the scene in the owners bakkie with a little cash, cellphones, a laptop and chainsaws. The victims who were left tied up managed to free themselves and called SAPS at 00:30, then the wife of the complainant was taken to hospital for treatment. In the other attack a farmer from Lothair in Mpumalanga, Jan Randell (75), was attacked for the second time in 2 years, and shot in the upper leg when he arrived home at his farm Bloemkrans in the Lothair, Ermelo area at about 18:00 on Thursday 26 March when he was about to pull his vehicle into the garage. Despite a broken leg bone, Mr Randell managed to drive away at speed but was involved in an accident when he reached the tar road. He drove into the back of a truck. Fortunately he had called for help on the two way radio before that, and his one son Philip, who farms on another farm in the area, heard it. Philip and Mr Randell?s other son Jantjie immediately chased to their father?s farm, and found their father unconscious in his bakkie in the grass next to the road. He only regained consciousness half an hour later and was very shaken up, so much so that he asked what had happened. During the previous attack on him Mr Randell was also attacked outside the farm house. He was dragged into the house and kicked and beaten and the attackers tried to suffocate him. Mr Randell was operated on in the Unitas hospital in Pretoria on Friday afternoon and his sons can?t even visit him because of the COVID-19 lockdown. Mr Randell has lived and farmed in the Ermelo area, producing food, his whole life, the last 2 decades on Bloemkrans. Mr Randell could not tell what happened himself yet but it is suspected there were 2 or 3 attackers. We could see no reference in any media of the Belfast attack but the attack on Mr Randell was reported on by Netwerk24, a media site hiding the attacks and murders behind a pay wall, literally making profit our of our tragedy. This is called \""Gap News\"", a form of fake news where they omit important or salient facts, events or reports. No arrest has been carried out in any of the incidents. Whilst the attention of the liberal mainstream media and the public is on the chaotic lockdown in South Africa, no attention is given to brutal attacks on the elderly, farmers and normal citizens alike, in South Africa who despite their age still farm, produce food and employ people. We at SA-NEWS will not ignore it and will report these brutal attacks to you so please support us by sharing these articles, and supporting our advertisers. ",sa-news,0
"Should China Pay For Our CoronaVirus Losses? Two US Firms Sue China For Criminal Negligence For Covering Up Corona \""Chinese\"" Virus Outbreak in Wuhan!","While Ramaphosa is panicking trying to clean up China?s mess in SA, US President Donald Trump recently lashed out at China over the \""Chinese Virus\"" as he called it. At a recent press conference where he said that China did not inform the US about the crisis, and said that he is a little upset with the Chinese authorities, Trump added that had everyone been informed a few months back, when China knew, a lot of lives could have been saved. Even the W.H.O. warned a while back that the next big epidemic could come from wet markets in China, but China willfully ignored it? Yet it appears China is still busy with subterfuge and blatant lies and cover-ups. China reported a twenty-one million drop in cellphone users for the past three months, which could indicate that the #CCPvirus casualties are far more than they admitted. One would imagine in a lockdown situation, there would be more cellphone accounts, as people try keep in touch with each other? Also, as we reported, China was also activity engaged in political correct propaganda in Italy, encouraging and blackmailing Italians through guilt to \""hug a Chinese\"", with devastating consequences, as we can all see. Italy now has far more deaths than China even! Why would China be pushing such a propaganda campaign in Italy, if they have nothing to hide? Even in South Africa the ANC regime and Naspers (Media24), who have massive business interests in China, are hard at work trying to save China?s image, as we reported here, doing their best to create the impression the Chinese Virus came from Europe and that the white man is to blame again, after all Chinese people are a privilege class, along with blacks in South Africa. The fact that China is still up to dirty tricks is key in two US firms deciding to launch class action suits against China now already, even though the pandemic is still raging and spreading at an exponential rate. The Berman Law Group is one that has sued China ? blaming it for covering up the Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. Can China be held legally accountable and if so, how can China be made to pay for its negligence? A question which will have the Communist ANC, SACP and Naspers squirming in their seats! Jeremy Waters is the chief strategist at the Berman Law Group who answered claims this suit is just a distraction and that there is no proof yet to back these claims. He said the legal strategy behind the lawsuit, that the lawyers in the firm are utilizing, is a class-action based against a foreign nation, which allows you to sue under certain exceptions for their bad acts, that have harmed citizens of the United States, and abroad. These laws have been used many times before. The government of Sudan was sued, the government of Libya was sued, the government and personnel of Cuba were sued, national corporations of China have been sued where the Chinese government owns the corporations. So this has happened many times in the history of the United States. Obviously the ANC regime would never do it as China owns them and they dance to Xi Jinping?s tune? Jeremy said they decided the time to act was now, even though we?re still in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, so they filed a lawsuit at this point in time to put China on notice of their bad acts, \""if we don?t put them on notice now, maybe China will continue to do bad acts as it goes forward. So in the United States we have the right to file the lawsuit, to put this country on notice, to let China know that we know what they?ve done, and that we don?t appreciate what they?ve done and most importantly, that they?re going to have to pay for what they?ve done, and I want to be very specific, we are not talking about the people of China, we do not hold individuals and China responsible as they they are in the same position we are. This information was hidden from them too. We are talking about the Chinese government and the people behind all this now.\"" He said that even though China enjoys sovereign immunity, it can be held liable for a pandemic in an American court because there are exceptions to the foreign Sovereign Immunities Act involving commercial activity involving terrorism, and involving other types of activities that have harmed citizens in the United States. \""So these acts that the Chinese government has conducted, that fall into those exceptions in our opinion and our lawyers believe that they will be able to pursue it under those exceptions.\"" Mr Waters said there are trillions of dollars in damages and pointed out that China is a world superpower. \""They?re one of the wealthiest nations in the world and one of the more powerful nations in the world, and they used that power to conceal this disease, this virus, in order to protect their economic interests, and when they did that, they harmed the citizens of USA and the citizens other countries around the world. By doing that in the United States, they will be held accountable and if we prevail, will be held to pay for the damages that they?ve caused, not only to the individuals who have unfortunately been diagnosed with this terrible virus, some of whom have died, some of whom are in ICU, but also the businesses, small and large in the United States, the individuals who have been harmed, the people who work in restaurants, who are waiters and waitresses and are out of jobs, valet people, people that work maintenance. There are hundreds of millions of people at home in the United States right now, and the economy is taking a huge hit as a result of this, and China will be held accountable if we win in this lawsuit, to have to pay actual damages to these individuals and these companies.\"" Whatever the decision is in the end, lawyers in USA have the right to serve China through the Hague Convention process which would allow them to serve China with a complaint and require them to come to court in the states. If China refuses to do so, that would say a lot about them avoiding responsibility, so it is expected that they will respond to the complaint and accept service. Waters went on to say that if China refuses to do so, there will be other steps that they can ask the court and other means to put pressure on China to participate in this lawsuit, so that they are held accountable. \""They need to be held accountable for what they?ve done both here and abroad. They have trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars and control a large part of the world economy, this is not something they should take lightly. This is a very serious situation they?ve caused for the United States.\"" This chart indicates how China mitigated their losses by spreading of the virus to the rest of the world, so if it was a response to losing the trade war?, a bio weapon? Will we ever know? China gained financially It is up to other countries if they also would want to pursue lawsuits, and it depends on what different country?s laws allow, but this is a worldwide pandemic that has never happened before, but it happened as a result of China concealing what was going on there, so there may be a call for the laws internationally to be changed, to allow for the pursuit of the damages against China. Something ANC will no doubt oppose. Because this is so devastating to people around the world, finding the laws is the second step, first you need global consensus building around the demand for such legal action against China. China has handled and controlled too much of our economy for too long and it is time for that to change, around the world too, time to tell China, no more that this cannot happen anymore, we cannot be affected by their bad acts just because they?re worried about their economy. The two lawsuits against China, one in Florida and one in Texas and hopefully there will be a global consensus to make China pay for their criminal negligence when they unleashed a pandemic by trying to hide the virus. The anger against the Chinese Communist Party is growing, in China and abroad. A copy of the lawsuit from the Florida law firm blames China for failing to report the disease. It says China acted slowly and \""put their head in the sand\"". The lawsuit blames China for covering up the Wuhan outbreak. This legal challenge will expose every aspect of how the first case emerged towards the end of 2019, how China did not report the outbreak till January, how test samples were destroyed, how whistleblowers were muzzled, etc. The Florida lawsuit touches each of these points and it demands damages from Beijing. lawsuit china corona virus It highlights China?s criminal negligence and here are some of the telling statements from the lawsuit: \""China?s new COVID-19 was spread human-to-human by the third of January, but they told the public otherwise, in other words the government lied.\"" \""President Xi Jingping originally stated that he directed officials to contain the virus on the 7th of January, but it has emerged that he did not do that, he actually waited to the 22nd to do direct containment, meaning the Chinese government was awfully late in acting.\"" \""Leaders in Wuhan held a public dinner for more than 40,000 families on the 18th of January, despite knowing the ease of human-to-human spread of the virus!\"" If this isn?t criminal negligence, then what is?\"" But will a legal challenge work? Can China be held accountable in international courts? Legal professionals have different opinions on this. Fox News spoke to Natasha Darsh Andreevna, an Israeli lawyer who specializes in suing terrorist groups and governments for human rights abuses. She says that while China enjoys sovereign immunity, it should be held accountable for trying to conceal the Wuhan virus from the world. The lawsuit may or may not work, but it does send a message. These two cases will be landmark ones and could set a precedent for governments being held accountable for criminal negligence that cost thousands of lives the world over, because as we all know, current structures like the ICC and UN are laughable and exist only to exert their own globalist power trying to undermine national governments, not support them! There is a lot to find out here and certainly many books will be written about in the years to come, for those of us that survive. The relationship between the Chinese Communist Party, ANC, Naspers, SACP, etc. needs to be exposed, but mainstream media will never do that. ",sa-news,0
#RamaphosaLies Solidarity Lodges Complaint With Human Rights Commission Against Racist ANCs Race Based Solidarity Disaster Fund For COVID-19 Mitigation!,"\""CoronaVirus Knows No Borders or Nationalities\"" Ramaphosa said. He Lied. As we predicted, the Chinese CoronaVirus crisis is just another opportunity for ANC gangsters to enforce its racial black supremacist quota ideology, and fill their own and their crony?s pockets. The ANC released its racial classification guidelines for aid to small business under the CoronaVirus economic lockdown, after calling it fake news that only black small businesses will be assisted. They lied. It is definitely NOT fake news that race will play a roll, when it comes to the granting of official assistance to small business people during the lockdown period. Race WILL play a roll and this is why Solidarity announced they have laid a complaint in this regard with the Human Rights Commission. This step comes after the government had denied that assistance will only be given to small businesses with a 51% black ownership, although an official document of the Department for Small Business Development stipulating such a requirement was circulating on social media. This was subsequently called fake news but it was NOT fake news, because it was an official draft document from the Department, although not made official yet. Yet now the Minister Khumbudzo Ntshaveni herself has released a whole raft of racial classification regulations which will be official policy guidelines when officials have to decide which small businesses get help and which ones don?t. When ANC \""officials\"" make race based decisions, we all know who wins and who loses? How can an unexpected national emergency be part of the NDP? The minister for Small Business Development, made a speech on Tuesday in which she said that the demographics of the country will indeed play a roll when it comes to who will get official help and who doesn?t. Demographics refers to the racial make up of the country. Solidarity has also objected against the official government aid package of R 200 Million that the Department of Tourism has promised to give to small businesses in the tourism sector. The department has issued a press statement in which it says that at least 70% of the businesses that will be helped must be black owned, 50% must be owned by women, 30% owned by youth and 4% owned by people with disabilities. As usual and always, there will be nothing left for white people who employ a lot of black people, and criminals and gangsters (tenderpreneurs) playing the ANC?s racial quota game will make a killing. Solidarity will also prepare a court action to oppose this racial classification in a time of crisis they have announced. Dirk Hermann of Solidarity trade union has said that whilst the county must prepare itself for a period of unknown suffering because of the economic lockdown, the ANC sees this unprecedented disaster as yet another opportunity to enforce its racial ideology. Mr Hermann has also pointed out that it is one thing to only consider blacks for government tenders, but a totally different thing to shut down all economic activity because of the Chinese Virus, and then refuse to help white small business people on the basis of skin colour. However this will come back to bite the ANC, as they clearly have no clue how economies work, but what else do we expect from communists?? Oh yes, genocide of course. 100 Million and still counting it seems? BBBEE is racist",sa-news,0
"#FarmAttack Female Free State Farmer Stabbed 11 Times in the Back, Piercing Both Lungs & Left in Freezer Room For Dead!","There were two farm attacks in the Free State in a 12 hour period over the past weekend. In the first one, a woman who farms and lives alone, on the farm Morester in the Bothaville area, Wilma Swanepoel (66), was stabbed in her back 11 times and had both her lungs pierced, on Sunday afternoon 22 March around 17:45. It happened after she went to look at the cattle and had returned home after dropping her farm workers off. Three black males ambushed her at a closed gate, which she always leaves open. In the struggle she tried to shoot with her revolver but it did not want to fire. The attackers then took the revolver from her and tried to shoot her with it, clearly displaying an intent to kill her. Luckily it still did not go off. The attackers then locked her in a freezer room. She was discovered there the next morning by her daughter, who stays in Bothaville. The daughter went to look for her mother when she could not reach her on her cellphone. Swanepoel told her daughter that the attackers came back twice during the night to look in the freezer, but that she lay still and pretended to be dead. She lost a lot of blood but was able to tell her daughter what happened. It is not certain what was stolen from Swanepoel?s safe because the keys are gone. Swanepoel was admitted to Wilmed Park Hospital in Klerksdorp, where, according to her daughter, Trysie Smit, she is in a stable condition and is being sedated. In the other farm attack Dries van der Walt of the farm Driekop outside Tweeling was held up by 4 black male attackers on Monday morning 23 March at 05:50 and forced into his farm house. He was tied up and assaulted with fists. The attackers then took 6 firearms from his safe, 2 hand guns, a rifle and 3 shotguns. The attackers fled with Van der Walt?s bakkie which was later found abandoned, eliminating the economic motive. Clearly they only wanted weapons, meaning it is a war? Free State Agriculture (FSA) says it is concerned about the two farm attacks that took place within 12 hours of each other in the Free State. Dr. Jane Buys, a security risk analyst at Free State Agriculture, says farmers were targeted in both attacks, in Bothaville and Tweeling respectively. Another farmer, Japie van den Berg, was ambushed at his farm gate on 25 February this year in the same area of Driekop, but his farm is closer to Vierfontein. With farm attacks, which have been happening for 3 decades, on the rise, it seems the Police are totally uninterested or incapable of putting a stop to it, and the readiness of some farmers to counter the attacks is also highly questionable.

Rupert & Oppenheimer Give R1 Billion Each to Fight CoronaVirus  Why Arent Super Rich BEE Enabled Black Businessmen Giving Too?,"THE GRAVE COST TO THE ECONOMY ? It seems the white industrialists are aware how Corona will affect their own bottom line, and have stepped up to the plate to protect their consumer driven interests (and get a tax break), but why have the many super rich black businessmen created by BEE & corruption not done the same? Or super rich trade unions like COSATU? Does the economy not affect them? No, their profit is not based on sales and consumers, it comes from BBEEE & Government grants, tenders and corruption, so as long as the ANC is in power, their taxpayer powered gravy train steams on, and the CoronaVirus will just be another money stealing opportunity, with the begging bowl to the West, who they hate so much. The Chinese Corona virus is undoubtedly a grave crisis facing us and if allowed to spread into the winter, it will lead to untold suffering and millions becoming sick and thousands dying. The Rupert and Oppenheimer families have shown their commitment by giving R1 Billion Rand each to fight this virus and mitigate the impact on ordinary people. This money will be put in a central fund called the Solidarity Fund and is aimed at helping small business people get through the just announced lockdown period of 3 weeks. One now wonders where is the likes of Patrice Motsepe on this? Guptas? Or NASPERS, who have such a vested interest in the mass black market? One also wonders what measures the ANC government and their cadres in each and every state department and state owned enterprise they control/plunder, will put in place to steal less and save on their gigantic salary packages and bonuses, so that more money can be available to fight the Chinese Corona virus? Why don?t they stop bailing out SAA for instance with billions of Rands yearly and simply privatize it, to stop ANC officials plundering it? The Chinese Corona virus will be devastating to us, especially because it will cause our already underperforming economy to drastically shrink further. The fund created by Mr Rupert and the Oppenheimer family will probably not be enough to help everyone. Many families won?t be able to earn enough because they work for themselves and won?t be able to carry on their businesses during the lockdown, which starts on Thursday night and will last until April 16. Economist Dawie Roodt says the economy will shrink by as much as 3 % in the first quarter and up to 20 % in the second quarter of this year. Crime levels, already through the roof, will no doubt rise. Murders will probably increase as well. The Chinese Corona virus is a cruel blow and hits a country hard, especially one that has been slowly brought to its knees over a period of 26 years, by another slow eating but very effective ANC virus, with its racial quota BEE policies and communist ideologies. This will be difficult. Time to take precautions, stay at home, wash hands and hunker down and hope we all come out on the other side. ",sa-news,0
Seven Harmless Defenseless Grandparents Murdered in 7 Days! How Much Worse Will It Get Under CoronaVirus Lockdown? Will We Ever Know?,"\""You can tell the nature of a society by how they treat their elderly\"" ? While we are distracted with wall to wall coverage of the CoronaVirus and counting of Corona virus cases, who is counting the elderly being violently murdered? Yet another harmless elderly white man has been murdered by cowards that Cyril protects. This time in Villiersdorp in the Western Cape which brings to seven the number of elderly white people murdered in a week. Mr Casper Steenkamp (87), a \""selfless\"" retired teacher who obtained a doctor?s degree in education, was found murdered on Saturday evening on the back porch of his neighbour. The suspicion is that he had heard a noise in his neighbour?s house in the evening and was murdered by the murderers when he interrupted them. He was found by 2 care givers who look after Mr Steenkamp?s wife Bessie (86), who has dementia. Mr Steenkamp gave the care givers off for the afternoon but they had to be back for the night shift. When they arrived home they could not find Mr Steenkamp and looked for him. They eventually found his body on the neighbour?s back porch and called the Police. A Police spokesman told Maroela Media that Mr Steenkamp was stabbed with a knife. Mr Steenkamp?s neighbour also confirmed his house was broken into and some items stolen. He was away for the day. Mr Steenkamp?s son, also Casper, said his father was a very selfless person who loved to help others and changed the lives of his pupils at school. The other murders we reported on in the last week are: ? Oom Koos Dreyer (76) was found murdered in his house, corner of Tambotie and Ockert street, Groblersdal on Friday night 20 March at around 23:00. His body was found in the bathroom and there were signs of a violent struggle in the TV room, bathroom and garage. The motive for the murder is unknown at the moment and Police were on the scene and investigating. A Police spokesman confirmed Mr Dreyer had several wounds to his body. This latest murder follows the following murders that all happened in the past week: ? Alwyn van Zyl (79), whose family has farmed on the family farm at Bad se Loop, between Nylstroom and Naboomspruit for generations, was murdered by farm attackers who tied his hands and feet and then strangled him on his bed on Thursday night 19 March 2020. His wife was tied up and assaulted in another room during the attack. ? Charles Hart (75) was found beaten to death in his farm house in the Henderson area, Toise, between Cathcart and Stutterheim, EC on Sunday 15 March 2020. ? Colin Leslie Britz (65) was shot and killed by farm murderers in his farm house in the Elandskraal area, Dundee, KZN on Monday 16 March, 2020. ? Neels Combrink (60) was attacked on his farm at Niekerkshoop, Northern Cape on Wednesday 18 March, 2020 and tortured when he was burned with a hot clothes iron on his stomach. ? The bodies of a retired church minister and his wife, Dominee Hannes Beukes (70) and Ibel Beukes (67), were discovered locked in the boot of their car, which was found in a field near the Bethal dam. A passing motor cyclist discovered the vehicle late in the afternoon and alerted Police. A spokesman for the Police said the couple left their house to drop their domestic worker off at Emzinoni which is a small township outside of Bethal. They were never seen alive again and their bodies had visible and serious injuries. At this stage there are no leads as to any suspects. Dominee Beukes was the local Hervormde Kerk Dominee for many years in town whilst Ibel was a teacher. ",sa-news,0
"#ParasiticParastatale The ANC is the Worst Virus to Hit Any Country! Road Accident Fund (RAF) Debt Levels Chasing Eskom Debt Levels, Possibly Reaching R800 BILLION in 5 Years!","Hand in the till? The Road Accident Fund is yet another parasitic parastatale hijacked by ANC gangsters, to openly fleece and rob the taxpayer. RAF?s debt is now getting as bad as Eskom debt levels and lawyers are in on the looting, getting about a quarter of its yearly income, with a self inflicted debt rising to R800 BILLION in the next 5 years! Will they plunder our pension funds to pay this corruption fueled debt too? Even without the 56 murders a day, rapes and violence, the ANC is the greatest virus that ever hit South Africa, or any other country for that matter. The Corona virus is a storm in a teacup compared against the havoc that the ANC has wreaked on South Africa in the last 26 years. Like a virus, the disease of corruption, bribery and out and out theft has become endemic in all parts, departments and branches of the ANC regime. Now more chaos looms in the Road Traffic Accident Fund (RAF) and it could further delay payouts to people who really need it. As it is people wait around 5 years for a successful pay out from RAF. The acting head of the RAF, Collins Letsoalo, a former traffic officer, says the current RAF debt is R324 Billion and could rise to R800 billion in the next 5 years, which will make Eskom?s debt of about R 450 billion look like a cup of tea in comparison. Sounds like Collins Letsoalo is making provision for forthcoming plundering instead of managing the current situation, but don?t worry, our pensions will cover that right? It is also clear that law companies acting on behalf of the RAF are milking the system, well, when does a lawyer not milk a client, because the RAF spends about R10 Billion per year on 84 law companies that act on the RAF?s behalf, which works out to an average R120 Million per company, being paid to push files around! Like all ANC regime business / plunder models, the current model is unsustainable and now Letsoalo has canceled the contracts with their 84 lawyer companies. The lawyer companies have taken the RAF to court over the cancellation and the first judgment in the matter will be out this coming Friday. In the meantime the RAF owes R19 Billion to claimants whose cases were already settled. According to Rapport, the RAF is earning around R3,52 Billion per month out of the fuel levy which is about R42 billion per year. Legal cost of R 10 Billion to lawyers per year does seem way too much at about a quarter of the RAF income. In this way the whole system is rigged to keep feeding lawyers. ",sa-news,0
"ANCs Pro Black Group RET Tells Whites Not To Stock Up for Social Distancing, Yet ANC Gauteng Hands Out Soap In Black Areas Only?","The ANC?s black supremacist Radical Economic Transformation (RET) group in Gauteng, linked to Jacob Zuma, has condemned bulk buying by the mainly minority white South Africans, even though photographic evidence (pictured) suggests blacks are just as busy stocking up, to prepare & practice social distancing. Yet at the same time the ANC in Gauteng is accused of handing out soap in black areas only? After Ramaphosa declared a national disaster due to the coronavirus, many went out on shopping sprees to stock up, in order to limit trips to the shop and stay at home, to prevent catching or spreading the virus. As a result some goods went out of stock and shop owners increased prices. One shop in Florida, JHB increased the price of masks from R10 to R50 overnight and prices of sanitiser around Johannesburg also went up before going out of stock, however this was a global phenomenon in response to the CoronaVirus and many have been stocking up long in advance, with the less prepared having to \""panic buy\"". RET?s representatives Carl Niehaus and Sibusiso Hadebe said companies owned by \""white monopoly capital\"" were exploiting the crisis to make money from the poor. They also called \""on the minority of mainly white South Africans, who have the financial means to indulge selfishly in bulk buying and food hoarding to desist from doing so.\"" They suggested \""We will only be able to overcome the scourge of the coronavirus when we unite and live out our common humanity in the manner that we care for each other as fellow South Africans,\"" yet the Gauteng ANC, MEC and the National Government seems not to think we are all equal and has been accused by the Patriot for Minorities group, for providing precautionary materials and measures against the CoronaVirus in black areas only! In a press release the Patriot for Minorities group said it is obvious that minority groups such as white and coloured people are largely ignored and that little or no precautionary measures are taken in the poorer sections of these minority groups. The group said they were aware that the Gauteng government was distributing soap, but to date has not distributed any virus combating materials among white, coloured or Indian residential areas. They say it proves that white and brown lives are not on the majority black government?s priority list and that they are concerned about our elderly and young children and demand that white and coloured communities also be protected. They challenged the Premier of Gauteng, David Makhura, to provide examples of the Gauteng government helping white and coloured communities to combat the virus. \""The next few weeks will show if the ANC are really concerned about all South Africans and not just the black majority,\"" they said. Premier of Gauteng, David Makhura Premier of Gauteng, David Makhura on 3 March BEFORE CoronaVirus was taken seriously? Meanwhile the racebaiting ANC?s RET group went further and criticized the ANC government and ANC headquarters for using sanitisers, soaps, masks and other goods procured from white-owned companies. They were concerned that products and services from Bidvest and its subsidiaries were \""disproportionately procured\"". \""We demand that our ANC, as the governing party, must ensure all the products required to protect our people from exposure to the coronavirus must be procured from companies that are genuinely black owned,\"" they said. However when it comes to safety and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 Virus we are sure most people will not look at the colour of money? not that anything has stopped black businesses from setting up and manufacturing things, quite the contrary, blacks have received more handouts than any other generation ever, and it is white businesses that are being institutionally and structurally oppressed and excluded from the market in many areas?

"Five Grandparents Including 3 Farmers Brutally Murdered in Five Days in \""Progressive\"" South Africa, But We Are Told To Worry About #CoronaVirus?","What kind of a so called \""nation\"" is SA, when day after day our frail and elderly can be picked off at will and murdered in callous ways, yet we, and the authorities do nothing, except try fob it off by saying it affects all races, which is not doing anything, because the perpetrators are almost exclusively black males. Europeans have always counted their dead, and there is nothing stopping Africans from counting their own dead, except maybe their own black majority government, which is doing everything in their power to force our attention on a virus that \""knows no borders or nations\"". The coming days and weeks will expose them for what they are: a despotic gang of mafia, who have no clue or indeed interest in actually running a country or protecting its vulnerable citizens, except to plunder the once proud successful first world nation, until every single citizen is equally poor, destitute and broken! Farmer Alwyn van Zyl (79) from Bad se Loop, between Modimolle and Mookgohong (Naboomspruit) became the third elderly farmer to be murdered within five days, when his hands and feet were first tied with cloth before he was strangled on his bed on the night of 19 March, 2020, just before midnight. His wife Rene (66) was also tied up but the attackers, at least 6 black males, only assaulted her but did not kill her. Kobus Briel, son-in-law of the Van Zyl couple, told Netwerk24 that he received the call from a farm worker around 00:30 that there was a farm attack. His own house is about 1 km away from the Van Zyl house and on arrival he discovered Mr Van Zyl dead in his room. Fortunately Mrs Van Zyl slept in another room because Mr Van Zyl uses an oxygen mask at night, and she was tied up in her room, She said the attackers demanded money and firearms and in the end they fled with small items like phones and clothing. Mrs Van Zyl, who was not seriously injured but severely traumatized, managed to untie herself and walked about 300 metres to the house of a farm worker who called the children of the Van Zyls. Members of the Heritage Protection Group (HPG), a volunteer group, searched for the attackers the whole night in bushes on the farm after following their tracks. Ex colonel Sakkie Lauwrens of HPG told Netwerk24 that they managed to arrest 3 attackers. This latest farm murder follows the brutal murders which SA-News reported on, of Charles Hart (75) who was found beaten to death in his farm house in the Henderson area, Toise, between Cathcart and Stutterheim, EC on Sunday 15 March 2020, and, Colin Leslie Britz (65) who was shot and killed by farm attackers in his farm house in the Elandskraal area, Dundee, KZN on Monday 16 March, 2020. Neels Combrink (60) was also attacked on his farm at Niekerkshoop, Northern Cape on Wednesday 18 March, 2020 and tortured when he was burned with a hot clothes iron on his stomach. Bethal in Mpumalanga was also left in shock on Wednesday 18 March, after the bodies of a retired minister and his wife, Dominee Hannes Beukes (70) and Ibel Beukes (67), were discovered locked in the boot of their car, which was found in a field near the Bethal dam. A passing motor cyclist discovered the vehicle late in the afternoon and alerted Police. A spokesman for the Police said the couple left their house to drop their domestic worker off at Emzinoni which is a small township outside of Bethal. They were never seen alive again and their bodies had visible and serious injuries. At this stage there are no leads as to any suspects. Dominee Beukes was the local Hervormde Kerk Dominee for many years in town whilst Ibel was a teacher. In all these attacks large groups of black male attackers were involved and items like firearms and phones stolen. It is clear from the international attitude to South Africa and other despotic african nations, that they condone the plundering and destruction of these nations, while they quietly build up their globalist African Union, and once these nations are on their knees, they will be offered relief, if they give up their sovereignty to the AU ? exactly as the globalists did with the EU. Allowing the CoronaVirus to run rampant could be just another part of this strategy. It might be easy for Ramaphosa to ignore farm murders and the general level of violent crime in SA, but he cannot ignore COVID-19 so he has to make a drama out of addressing it. ",sa-news,0
"VIDEO: \""Hug a Chinese\"" Activists Blamed For Italys High #CoronaVirus Infections as Cyril & The Pro China Left Try Bullsh*t The Virus With Virtue Signalling & PC Speeches!","As Italy?s shocking death toll eclipses even China?s, we see that Trump was right again: this virus is like warfare to China and we wonder what evil the #CoronaVirus will expose in Africa? Already Ramaphosa and the pro China ANC propaganda machine, including the complicit mainstream media, have you convinced that ALL South Africa?s, and indeed all Africa?s CoronaVirus infections, came from Europe? Really? Well where did Europe get the virus from? Yes, China, but shhhh that is racist. In fact \""anti racist\"" campaigners have been blamed for the rapid mass spread of the virus in Italy FROM China, which ultimately led to many South Africans in Italy, contracting the virus and bringing it back to SA. In Northern Italy, which has many Chinese manufacturing workers, these left wing traitors to humanity, who pose as anti racist activists, would rather you or your grandparents contracted COVID-19 and even potentially die, just as long as you don?t dare point fingers at China! It appears Ramaphosa, ANC and the leftist mainstream media are playing the same game in South Africa! Cyril gave the game away when he used the exact same phrase that all other globalist leaders used: \""This virus knows no borders or nationalities\"" as if they had all been briefed! This is almost an admission of guilt that this catastrophic event is being used in a very subversive and evil way for political gain by the globalists, who stand to lose the most from it! When other eastern nations banned flights from China it was fine, but as soon as Trump did, it was \""Raaayycciiiss\""! As the new virus was rapidly spreading in China, anyone in the West, who suggested a temporary travel ban with China was shouted down as racist. The communist Chinese government even waged a propaganda war against travel restrictions. Their agenda was that if the virus was going to wreak havoc on the sacred Chinese economy, they would make sure to mitigate those losses by letting it wreak havoc on the global economy too, thereby relatively minimising their losses, and so they resorted to a western-style \""fight racism campaign\"" to achieve this objective! Multiple Chinese government run media outlets even published propaganda videos, of people in northern Italy hugging Chinese people, to prove they are not racist! The mayor of Florence Italy even tweeted that his constituents should \""hug a Chinese\"" person and he was praised by both far-left organizations in Italy as well as the Chinese communist government. That same mayor is now quarantined in his own house? China pursued a malicious policy, that if their economy was going to suffer, they wanted to make sure it was a global suffering event and everyone gets hurt, to mitigate their own losses and loss of competitiveness in global standings. Western leftists, as stupid as usual, fell for this, hook, line and sinker, and eagerly did the bidding of the totalitarian Chinese regime. Northern Italy has a particularly large number of Chinese people travelling back and forth for various manufacturing industries, and appears to have been targeted. There had already been an outbreak in Germany when a Chinese person visited an automotive manufacturing plant, spreading the infection to numerous workers, but this outbreak was contained. Despite this contagion it was still deemed racist to shut down travel with China, and soon outbreaks exploded across northern Italy. But then as we know, Genocide is never far away from the left? Now ironically, on the same day that Italy surpassed China in total deaths, China announces NO NEW CASES of CoronaVirus! (apart from a few \""imported\"" ones)! Italy only has 60 Million people, China has 1.5 BILLION! Wow. Just wow! As the entire West is shutting down with devastating economic consequences, the same media, the same politicians, the same far-left organizations are absolving themselves of sin and forgetting they fought against banning flights, but are still screaming that it is racist to even mention that the virus came from China at all! Anyone using the phrase Wuhan flu or Chinese virus is deemed a racist! To date, all Ramaphosa, and his despotic Cabinet?s speeches were about what people in SA must do, NOTHING about what the ANC regime and its many overpaid cadre?s are doing to prepare for a potential demand for many thousands of hospital beds and deaths! Already African regimes have received millions in Aid from the West for CoronaVirus, and in fact this is what prompted Zimbabwe to declare a state of Disaster, despite not even having any declared cases! SA-News have eyewitness accounts of a Chinese father and son coughing their lungs out, for hours at an A&E in Kimberley, in a waiting room full of HIV AIDS patients (who have no immunity). The father and son were immediately sent home to be quarantined by the doctor, when he finally got to see them! Yet not a word in mainstream press about ANY Chinese person being infected or importing the virus ANYWHERE in SA, this despite many thousands of workers travelling back and forth to SA from China, just like in Italy! However, if one looks past the politicization and dramatisation for political gain, of the virus, we must understand that whether it was created by China or not, the COVID-19 Corona virus is here to stay. It will become part of our new normal, possibly as common as the normal flu, and most of us might get it at some time or another as the world builds up an immunity and develops a vaccine, hopefully sooner rather than later. It is not so much the virus that is doing damage, but society?s reaction to it, and manipulation of it by certain globalist countries and parties. The unprecedented international media attention however has hyped it up into some very dramatic consequences like the plunges in stock markets and near shutdown of the global economy. There has been too much incorrect and even fake conversations on the topic of the CoronaVirus up until now. It is time to once and for all get the facts, and most of all, its time for people worldwide to make a quantum shift in their thought process about this virus. Bluntly put, most of us will get this virus in the next year or 2. This is the logical conclusion if a vaccine is not found and we don?t get inoculated. As you know the common flu has been with us since we can remember and yes some people are dying from it, especially the elderly and those with weak immune systems and smokers. Most people who get the COVID 19 virus will survive but the mortality rate will be higher than with people with flu. It is estimated that between 2 ? 4 % of people getting the COVID 19 virus will die, once again mostly old people, those with bad immune systems and those with respiratory problems who might develop lung infection. So some people will die, just as some die with the flu. The virus will be rough for some 6 -7 % of patients. It will be like a bad flu to them and might lead to lung infection and hospitalization ? and that is the danger in Africa, hospitalisation! But they will hopefully survive the hospital and recover. For the rest of the COVID 19 patients, it will be nothing more than a stubborn cough and fever. They will be able to recuperate on their own at home with some bed rest only. To sum up, the vulnerable people as far as COVID 19 is concerned are old people, those with bad immune systems and the poor. The poor could be hard hit because they normally don?t eat healthy enough and don?t get enough vitamins to build up a strong immune system. This is the problem as far as our health is concerned. The other effect this virus will have is on the worldwide economy. This is where it has gotten serious. Worldwide, countries are placing themselves under lockdown. Flights are cancelled and people are canceling vacations. This is leading to an economic downturn and the worldwide fall in stock markets, including our own. That affects our pensions and investments because our pension funds do invest in stock markets. Countries that depend on foreign tourism like South Africa will lose income.",sa-news,0
#GangsterState Captures JB Marks Municipality As R53 Million Overtime Paid For Physically Impossible Hours & No Improvement in Service Delivery!,"It is a wonder that Potchefstroom is still standing with the open looting going on at a local black run municipality that is being operated like an organized crime syndicate by the local ANC, with its own slush fund. Mr Hans-Jurie Moolman, caucus leader of the DA in the JB Marks municipality, has revealed that the JB Marks municipality which comprises Potchefstroom and Ventersdorp has paid out an unbelievable amount of R53 Million since July last year to officials of the municipality. There can?t be any doubt anymore that the plundering of the municipality by the officials is the true purpose of the municipality now and not the delivery of services. Mr Moolman told Netwerk24 that the DA in the council will now ask for a special council meeting to discuss the matter and they will also ask to see the report into an alleged investigation that the JB Marks municipality claimed they began in the middle of last year already. Mr Moolman revealed that a breathtaking amount of 383,574 total hours were paid out as overtime by the municipality, since July last year to January 2020. One wonders what these officials actually did during all these hours? One would not even believe that one single hour was worked if you look at the state of the town. The total amount paid out in overtime was exactly R52,990,960 in just 7 months, revealed Mr Moolman. He said that when the DA analyzed the figures it became clear that some officials worked for up to 288 overtime hours per month, on top of their normal working hours of 180 per month! Analyze the number of hours and you will see that these officials were not at \""work\"" for 8 hours out of 24 per day. This is obviously physically impossible. It?s looting and it?s obviously out of control. Mr Moolman said the legally allowed limit for overtime for municipal workers is 45 hours per week. Moolman also said that the DA had written a letter to the mayor, Kgotso Khumalo, who has had protests in the streets demanding his removal, as well as the municipal manager, about the overtime issue in April 2019 already, but their letter was never responded to. Moolman said that when the DA brought up the matter of overtime in a subsequent council meeting last year , the municipal manager admitted there is a problem and promised an investigation, but this investigation was never heard of again and its now almost a year later. Well, maybe the man just lied Mr Moolman, promising an investigation when he clearly knew that they were not gonna do it and dodging accountability that way? And their scam was going going so well! The municipal manager was probably the first one in the queue at the overtime feeding trough. In the meantime the overtime paid out jumped from R2,5 Million in 2018 to an incredible R8,9 Million last year. Moolman also pointed to the fact that overtime is calculated at 1,5 or double the already high normal pay for these officials. We have also recently reported that the JB Marks Municipality operates a slush fund in the form of a trust, registered at a local lawyer in Potchefstroom which paid out an amount of R161,329 so that Councillors could go to the Durban July last year. The Hawks are investigating the Durban July trip and another transaction where R1,7 million was transferred to an outside account. We have also reported that the municipality?s own accounts show that an amount of R 2,6 million is outstanding and being owed by serving Councillors, who came into it in unlawful ways. Yet no steps is being taken against the councillors. The Auditor General?s report on the municipality for the 2018/19 year sketches a dark picture. The figures show an amount of R 2,1 Billion in irregular expenses, R833 Million in unlawful expenditure and R76 million in wasteful spending (no results achieved). The Auditor General also found that the municipality did not stick within acquisition procedures and did not keep proper track of expenses, and he had mentioned in his last and previous reports, that the municipality never investigates it when money is wasted, stolen or irregularly spent. Officials also don?t get investigated, even if complaints against them are lodged for financial irregularities. The local \""mayor\"" Kgotso Khumalo is fighting a decision by the North West provincial government to place Potchefstroom under administration in court, something for which taxpayer funds are also used of course. The Mayor, Kgotso Khumalo however led a \""delegation\"" of officials and councilors in a lavish trip to Sweden, to allegedly strengthen their partnership and asses progress made on various projects. Dare we ask if accounts were kept on that trip and if all gifts were declared? Lebo Ralekgetho Municipal Manager Lebo Ralekgetho Municipal Manager ",sa-news,0
"Farm Murders More Deadly Than #CoronaVirusSA With Two Murders in Two Days, Yet its Ignored by Mainstream Newspapers & TV Who Only Pander To Black Majority!","#COVID19 in South Africa has a long way to go to be anywhere near as deadly as farm murders, as another 2 white farmers have been murdered within 48 hours of each other. Collin Leslie Britz (65), from Dundee in KZN, and Charles Hart (75), from Henderson in Eastern Cape were callously murdered ? all that was taken was weapons. As usual the murders were totally ignored by liberal news outlets, although they do seem to have a lot of time to report on trivial matters concerning celebs & gossip etc. Liberal news media seem to take their orders from Ramaphosa and have never taken the matter of the murders of white farmers, and the associated threat to food security, seriously. The ANC regime and mass media like News24 continue to be in denial and mostly ignore it, and don?t think it?s newsworthy when white farmers are brutally butchered on their farms, unless maybe the murdered farmer comes from the affluent Cape Winelands region. Collin Leslie Britz, 65, who farmed on Craigmillar in the Elandskraal area, Dundee in Kwazulu-Natal, was found in his home with a gunshot wound to his head at 4pm on Monday, 16 March, 2020, said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. She said he was attacked by unknown suspects and his rifle and a pistol were also stolen. Britz was a bachelor and lived alone on the farm. The chairperson of the Umzinyathi farmers union Herman de Wet said Britz came back from the town at 2pm. He was informed by his staff that cattle were short, so he then took two of his workers and dropped them off near the grazing area to look for the cattle. Britz then returned home. Two other workers were working at the fence 300 meters from the house and the domestic worker was also on the farm. It?s unclear if the criminals were waiting for him but Britz appeared to have been having a cup of coffee when they pounced on him. There appears to have been a struggle. He put up a fight as his hands were bruised. The workers heard the shots and went to investigate and they found him a short while later in his house where he was dead from gunshot wounds. A case of murder was opened at Helpmekaar SAPS and Police are appealing to anyone who might have information about the suspects involved to contact their local police or Crime Stop on 08600 10111. In the other farm murder, a sheep farmer who also stayed alone, Charles Hart (75), was also brutally murdered on Saturday night 14 March or in the early morning hours of Sunday 15 March on his farm in the Henderson area, near Toise, between Cathcart and Stutterheim in the Eastern Cape. A neighbour who went to visit Hart on Sunday morning discovered a gruesome murder scene when he found Hart?s body in his home. Hart was beaten to death and one can hardly imagine the horror his last moments of life were, as it also appeared like the group of murderers held a party by drinking alcohol after the murder. All that was missing was Hart?s Land Cruiser bakkie, which was later found burnt out and a firearm from the house. You have to wonder why a Land Cruiser has no value to the farm murderers, but a firearm does? And so the murders of innocent white farmers and productive and law abiding members of the white community continues day after day and month after month, whilst it is almost never mentioned in the liberal mainstream media and whilst the President of the country, and his Police minister would sometimes visit a non white family who lost somebody to a crime, but never, ever a white family. In South Africa official sympathy from the black rulers and mainstream media are reserved only for the non white majority. ",sa-news,0
Theft of R80 Million Drought Relief & Raw Sewage in the Streets Forces North West Residents To Start a Tax Boycott!,"It must really burn for African Councilors, ANC Officials & Ministers to know Trump was right in calling South Africa a sh*thole, yet despite this, they still cannot resist the urge to steal everything and anything that is not put beyond their reach! A direst result of this unbridled looting is a Tax Boycott which is to begin in North West province, where the only fontein to be found is #Kakfontein. #TheAfricanWay of looting, destruction and lack of maintenance seems to have taken an accelerated path in the North West province, as sewage and other municipal services have totally collapsed in town after town. Like Ramaphosa said, the coffers are empty and there is nothing left to loot, never mind pay the actual bills! The stench of raw sewage is everywhere. Henk van Wyk, a resident and businessman of Stella told Netwerk24 that the whole sewage system in the area is developing into a full scale disaster. Raw sewage is overflowing in the system and then runs into dams and into a salt pan from where it flows into the ground water, which is the only source of water for Stella and the nearby township. In Koster, residents are complaining about raw sewage that has been flowing like a river into a gravel road and a nearby field in the vicinity of the Koster club. The gravel road has to be used by people, and residents say the stench is unbearable. Children from the township sometimes play in the sewage water. Residents also say that the town is getting less visitors, which is bad for local business, because of the stench in the town. A DA and VF+ councillor in the area told Netwerk24 that they are reporting all the sewage leaks but nothing is being done. Carel van Heerden, chairman of the Kgetleng rivier municipality ratepayers association ? the municipality comprises Koster, Derby and Swartruggens ? says they have informed the North West government that residents will start withholding taxes from the end of March. They will pay their tax into a trust account and provide services like sewage management, water provision and power management themselves. They say they have no choice because municipal services have collapsed and there is no prospect of it improving. Mr van Heerden told Netwerk24 that the North West MEC responsible for municipalities, has admitted to them that the municipality is bankrupt. Mr van Heerden says even R80 million of drought relief money is also gone and stolen. He also said 18 municipal vehicles were repossessed and traffic cops are having to do footbeat only. Mr Van Heerden also said they also want to approach the court to disband the council, force the provincial government to appoint an administrator and get a forensic investigation into the municipality done. In the Brits area, which is called the Madibeng municipality, raw sewage is also running like rivers into streets and causing damage to roads, especially in the Primindia neighbourhood according to Ronelle Gous, a local DA councillor.

"As #Conmunists, ANC Puts Big Government Above Human Rights Like Water, With Layers of Control Creating Corrupt Unaccountable Cadre Deployment Jobs, Gross Inefficiency & Bankruptcies!","SA is not an idiocracy anymore, nor is it a failed state, it is now a Socialist State captured by the elitist gangsters that rule and plunder it, as can be seen in the ANC controlled Free State where water shedding looms, as ANC controlled Bloemfontein?s water pressure is to be cut, because 3 ANC controlled municipalities owe ANC controlled Bloemwater more than R1 Billion! But then bankruptcy, like corruption, is a \""capitalist\"" word and thus irrelevant to the ANC, especially if you are spending someone else?s money? To be clear, Ramaphosa has repeatedly revealed his ideology, but we?ve either ignored or disregarded it, or heard what we wanted to hear. Ramaphosa is a committed Socialist and his address at the Centenary Celebrations of the birth of Nelson Mandela on 18 July 2018 (see below), was unambiguous. Ramaphosa has certainly never referred to himself as a free marketeer or capitalist or ?pro business? even, and his praising of mandela for having seen the light of communism, and letting it shape mandela as a leader, suggests Ramaphosa is even more of a Communist than mandela, but just like mandela, he has to hide it from the world. Ramaphosa constantly refers to the NDR, which is a blueprint taken straight from comrade Lenin?s copybook! The ANC in its blind commitment to implementing Socialism, has a deliberate strategy to create layers of different authorities, all controlled by its own cadre network, something Ace Magashule implemented so well in his time as Premier of the Free State, with predictably disastrous consequences. Bloemfontein municipality has Bloemwater as it?s water supplier and Centlec as it?s electricity supplier. Of course all of them are ANC cadre controlled, but Bloemfontein Metro owed Bloemwater an astronomical amount of R760 million for water at the end of January this year. Now the ANC controlled Bloemwater has told the ANC controlled Bloemfontein Metro that they will reduce the water pressure to the Metro to about 30% on 10 April! The ANC controlled Bloemfontein Metro is still under administration because it is bankrupt and another ANC cadre was appointed as the administrator. He is Adv Mzwake Mofokeng who did not answer his phone when phoned by Netwerk24. Another ridiculous situation is that the ANC controlled Kopanong municipality in the southern Free State, which serves towns such as Reddersburg and Trompsburg has notified Bloemwater that it won?t extend its own contract with Bloemwater, for the provision of water to the municipality. Bloemwater has installed equipment in that municipality that they use to deliver water to the municipality. So the Lord alone knows where that area will get water from in future. Maybe Kopanong just intends to use the water and not worry about paying or don?t think about the day of tomorrow, as is #TheAfricanWay. Kopanong is currently not paying Bloemwater for water either as can be expected, and another municipality not paying is Mantsopa which incorporates towns such as Tweespruit, Excelsior and Ladybrand. Together these 3 municipalities owe Bloemwater more than a R1 Billion according to sources which Netwerk24 spoke to. Dr Limakatso Moorosi, the CEO of Bloemwater, told Netwerk24 that the water provider can?t proceed with planned projects because municipalities don?t pay. The future of the Free State looks dark and dry under the ANC ever since Ace Magashule was appointed and turned it into a Socialist gangster state a decade ago, like a mini Venezuela. Targeting whites \""A DEFINING MOMENT IN HIS [MANDELA?S] POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT WAS WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO OVERCOME HIS HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF SOUTH AFRICA. THROUGH HOURS OF INTENSIVE ENGAGEMENT (manipulation) WITH COMRADES LIKE WALTER SISULU AND MOSES KOTANE, MANDELA CAME TO APPRECIATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF COMMUNISTS IN THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION. HE CAME TO UNDERSTOOD THE CLASS CONTENT OF THE NATIONAL STRUGGLE AND THE NATIONAL CONTENT OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE. THIS MOMENT IN THE EVOLUTION OF HIS POLITICAL THOUGHT IS INSTRUCTIVE, BECAUSE IT DEMONSTRATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH EVEN THE GREATEST LEADER IS SHAPED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF STRUGGLE, BY THE MOVEMENT AND BY THOSE AROUND THEM.\"" ? Cyril Ramaphosa, 18 July, 2018 Ramaphosa?s unashamedly complimenting Mandela?s being manipulated into adopting a totalitarian ideology that has been revealed as genocidal and unsuccessful on countless occasions, is very revealing. However Ramaphosa never mentions the advice Mandela received from China at Davos, forty-odd years later, namely, that a socialist economy would be a disaster. Ramaphosa has frequently mentioned his ongoing implementation of ?The National Democratic Revolution? (NDR) whose roots go way back to Lenin?s 1917 Theory of Imperialism! But when \""capitalists\"" offer bailouts or handouts, who are they to say no eh? ",sa-news,0
"ANC Takes R9 Billion From PRASA to Pay for e-Tolls! With No Brakes, Cellphones, Radios, Guards, SAPS or Money, The PRASA Train Has Derailed & Crashed Yet ANC Vultures Continue To Plunder it!","While Vodacom has cancelled its contract with PRASA for the provision of cellphones, which train drivers used to communicate with control rooms, it has also been revealed that ANC took R9 Billion from PRASA to pay for SANRAL e-tolls, according to Steve Harris from UNTU, which is a union within Prasa. Train drivers use these cellphones to get the verbal go-ahead to use routes to prevent accidents, because they can?t use the radio base system because that is not working either! Drivers now have to use their own cellphones, which is against PRASA rules (and probably against their insurance too). Harris says that the lives of train drivers are in danger when they can?t get authority to use routes and have to wait at crossings, because commuters who are angry about late trains have attacked train drivers in the past. He says criminals also prey on waiting commuters whilst they wait for late trains. Violence is #TheAfricanWay and the solution to everything it seems! Harris also made a shock revelation that the ANC regime has taken R9 Billion from PRASA?s budget the last 2 years, and gave it to SANRAL to operate their e-toll system because motorists don?t want to pay for it. Now that is quite a revelation. Harris also says there are no signs of PRASA security guards who are supposed to protect PRASA facilities and commuters after PRASA cancelled its tenders with security companies, at the end of October last year. The High Court then took a decision to extend the contracts until PRASA can put new contracts in place but PRASA appealed the ruling, meaning Prasa?s original decision stands. The infrastructure and facilities of PRASA are currently being carried away train rail by train rail and brick by brick. Cables are being dug up and it?s not hard to see how empty pieces of land with grass growing, won?t have new shack squatter camps emerging some time in future, where PRASA now has depots, rail lines and stations. #TheAfricanWay, the systematic consumption and destruction of all things that was once built up by white people, and given on a silver platter to the black majority is relentless. Harris also said there are no signs of the SAPS railways unit although such a unit does exist. Harris says he really doesn?t know where this SAPS unit is. But we can imagine them sitting and eating buckets of KFC chicken in an office somewhere, drawing big salaries, can?t we? Harris also said he can?t understand why there is an independent body called the Railway Regulator, which is supposed to look after train safety. It is no doubt just another statutory body brought into life so that more black ANC supporters can have high paying jobs, Mr Harris?

ANCs Minister Lindiwe Sisulu Rewards Criminality  Vusi Tshabalala Who Plundered Harrismith Municipality into Bankruptcy is Now Chief Whip for Free State Legislature!,"#TheAfricanWay A National Council of Provinces Committee meeting in Parliament heard about looting of Harrismith municipality, ended up in small talk with no decision as they ignored the crimes Vusi Tshabalala, the ANC criminal that ran the Maluti-a-Phofung municipality (Harrismith, Qwaqwa and Kestell), into the ground. Seems everyone wants a piece of Ace Magashule?s #GangsterState. Vusi Tshabalala, now sits in the Free State legislature as the chief whip while the matter of the total looting and destruction of the municipality in question, came up yesterday in a sitting of the National Council of Provinces. George Michalakis, a DA MP, said Tshabalala belongs in jail and requested a full forensic audit. Present during the meeting was Skully Nxangisa, the Free State MEC responsible, Blake Fatola, who is the administrator of the failed and ruined municipality, Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and a representative of Sedibeng Water and Eskom. Mokete Duma, who is the head of Nxangisa?s department, that of Co-operative Governance, said that when the administrator took over at the municipality, there were 443 ghost workers on the municipality?s paysheet and they had to write off R720 million in debt. The municipality also owes R4,9 Billion to Eskom and tens of millions in litigation debt. In typical #TheAfricanWay nothing was decided and nothing was resolved. It was a fruitless exercise in nothing at all and one wonders how much it cost the taxpayers to fly all the representatives down to Cape Town. Michalakis said that the Free State MEC Nxangisa won?t investigate Tshabalala because they are both ANC and they both sit (can?t say serve, as they only sit there and steal together), in the Free State legislature. The ANC majority in the committee then also decided that there would be no forensic investigation and that the committee will rather visit the municipality themselves (more doing nothing, more cost incurred to the taxpayers).

"Are ANC Lying About CoronaVirus Figures Like Their Chinese Communist Counterparts, and Are They Using it to Smear & Blame White People Again?","As the world hits 150,000 infections globally, \""Black Twitter\"" as it is known in SA, is spreading the myth that black people do not get Coronavirus! At the same time, one of the glaring things to come out of the surprisingly few coronavirus cases in South Africa, is that no infections were exported from China to SA? This despite there being multiple times more people coming from China to SA than Italy, yet it is Europe that the ANC seems intent on blaming for its Coronavirus infections. In fact an SABC \""executive producer\"" with a long title, made an entire report, with fancy graphics, about all Africa?s infections coming from Europe, even though there are over a million Chinese workers in Africa! However the Twitterati and WHO had a heart attack when people called it the \""ChineseCorona\"" virus, even though that is where it started, but it is ok to point fingers at Europe? WHO was also very happy to announce that the virus? focus has now moved to Europe! Ironically, it is in Europe that a famous black footballer contracted the virus, but \""black Twitter\"" ignores that. Then of course it is more likely a european person will be more aware of the need and be responsible enough to come forward, when they suspect they have the virus, any Chinese person would have a deep seated fear of authority from the Communist regime and would also distrust the ANC incompetence, so would probably quietly try deal with it themselves, as we saw in so many cases in Wuhan, where many just quietly locked themselves up in their apartments. A black person will no doubt go consult a witch doctor, because the ANC has not yet offered money or free stuff, like in Communist China where people were offered rewards for reporting neighbors or family with infections! For South Africa with a population exceeding 60 Million, to only have 38 cases despite not having implemented ANY counter measure or quarantines or banning of flights, is simply not logical. In fact we suspect, one of the ANC?s favourite pastimes has come to the fore again ? that of deliberately misdiagnosing the cause of death! There have been cases of fatal swine flu reported, all conveniently ignored by the mainstream media. Swine flu is from a similar family as the coronavirus COVID-19 so an easy enough \""mistake\""? This is important as the death rate can be used to roughly calculate the infection rate as was outlined here. We suspect SA has at least 1,000 cases by now. Most countries have now removed the geographical travel criteria for testing, has SA done this yet? As the ANC and its complicit cohort of concubine mainstream media pat themselves on the back, for returning a plane load of South Africans from China, who have been in quarantine there for 2 months, and are thus very safe (for Cyril Ramaphosa to use as a publicity stunt), we wonder what ANC had to promise the Conmunist Party in China for permission to extricate its citizens? The military plane (was SAA not safe enough?), transporting over 140 ? SA citizens repatriated from China, landed today at Gateway International Airport in Polokwane. The group also including volunteers and SANDF officials were transported by road to The Ranch Hotel in Polokwane (dare we ask who owns it?), where they?ll be quarantined for 21-days, which is a bit pointless given that they were already quarantined for a lengthy time in China and there are no checks for normal people coming from China anyway at airports! Corona virus repatriated from China Why quarantine them if anyone can come from China and just walk right into the country? Except of course to propagate and exaggerate the Ramaphosa publicity stunt. As we saw and know in Communist China, the Supreme Leader?s image is the most important thing. This is also a handy opportunity to give them a free holiday for a month, in return for votes, whilst the virus no doubt spreads unhindered through the country, like a virus does. The coming days and weeks will be very telling, but sadly, people will still vote ANC, because white people are the bad guys you know. When the crisis strikes, as it surely will, there will literally be a wailing which will soon be followed by the predictable demands for more free stuff, like free flights from China?",sa-news,0
"Everything Billionaire Ramaphosa Owns Was Given To Him Because He is Black, So What Was The Expensive Stud Bull \""Gift\"" AgriSAs Dan Kriek Gave To Ramaphosa For?","Former AGRI SA president and stud farmer Dan Kriek \""donated\"" an expensive stud bull to billionaire Cyril Ramaphosa, prompting wide speculation about what was behind it. It certainly put into question any \""independence\"" the AgriSA group might have claimed if their ex President was such close buddies with Cyril. Liberals like Kriek seem to strive for elitism wherever they are, in order to curry favour for themselves and a few liberal friends, but will we ever know? Cyril is fairly active in the game industry having previously sold 3 impalas for a whopping 2.6 MILLION Dollars (R42 Million) at an auction! So when Dan Kriek, a stud farmer from Tweeling in the Free State and the previous President of the liberal AGRI SA, \""donated\"" one of his South Devon stud bulls to Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday, it seemed paltry and almost appeared as if Dan Kriek was brown nosing or trying to bribe Ramaphosa. Was it just an appearance fee to promote the town? In this era of systemic and institutional corruption and state capture, it is a fair question to ask. The expensive gift (to normal people like me and you) was given when Ramaphosa addressed women in Tweeling during an event to mark International Women?s Day. The event was also attended by Sisi Ntombela, Free State Premier, who also hails from Tweeling. Ramaphosa accepted the gift and the stud bull will be delivered to Ramaphosa later in the year. Dan Kriek, the question is on everyone?s lips. Did you just pay a bribe to Cyril Ramaphosa? Was that a bribe? To get what? Did you pay that bribe to make sure your own farm and a few of your liberal friend?s farms are saved and not subjected to expropriation without compensation? Or will this bribe cement the principle of property ownership for all? Do you work just for yourself and a few of your liberal friends or do you work for all farmers in the country? WE THINK WE KNOW. Cyril is one of the richest men in the country. No, not a wealth built up by him stemming from his business acumen. That wealth came from stakes in successful companies built up by white businessmen over a century, and just given to Ramaphosa, because he had a black skin, in the years following the 1994 elections and transfer to ANC rule. So all those BEE stakes Cyril got for his blackness, was what made him rich, not his talent. And another question is: what benefit was derived from all those massive BBEEE shares in companies that Cyril got for free? Did that change his attitude towards the white community? No. Will it get Cyril to admit the existence of Farm Murders? Clearly not. Did that make him respect ownership of property? Clearly not. Cyril is the driving force behind the plan to plunder private pensions to throw in the Eskom bottomless pit. So you see Dan Kriek, bribes did not change Cyril. Everything Cyril has was \""donated\"" to him and still he has not changed. He took the white man?s gifts in the past and remained prejudiced against the white minority. The question is Dan: Just what is it you think you are trying to achieve that other whites, far richer and more powerful than you, have not managed to achieve with Cyril the despot, who has many a white traitor brown nosing him: ",sa-news,0
Zumas Nkandla is Nothing Compared To Ramaphosas Pension Grab! Transnet Pension Debacle 2.0 Will Impoverish Twice More Blacks Than Whites & Will Encourage More Eskom Corruption!,"#PensionCapture ? As certain as we were told by mainstream media that there were WMD?s in Iraq, Ramaphosa?s proposed pension plunder will also be propagandised into appearing as a good idea by the establishment, who will frogmarch South Africa into allowing them to steal from the many, to give to themselves and their cronies. There are also two silent partners pushing this scheme, namely the banksters, who stand to make serious commissions, and also rescue their bad loans to a bankrupt Eskom, and possibly extend this plunder to other bankrupt parastatals (who they also lent money for), once they have pried open the door to SA?s last pot of gold, and then of course there is the ANC?s ever present shoulder parrot, the South African Communist Party, who is never far. One of the Establishment?s complicit yesmen, News24?s Editor, Adriaan Basson, wrote an article which appeared in Naspers? left wing News24, in which he writes about a briefing that Ramaphosa gave to journalists. Their plan to take at least 10% (like we believe it will end there?), of all pensions ? government and private ? was discussed and defended by Ramaphosa in the briefing. It was also revealed that #PensionGrinch Ramaphosa is actually a main driver of the pension capture plan. To quote Basson: \""Ramaphosa is absolutely convinced that the pensions plan ? to move R250bn of Eskom?s debt into a special purpose vehicle, that will be serviced by the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) ? is the correct and only way to go\"". Sounds like President George Bush pushing for war in Iraq? However the far left and radical liberal Basson was somewhat less supportive of the plan in this column, than in his previous column, maybe because we exposed his flip flop from initial open resistance, to open support for this pension theft plan, in a previous article we published. To get a third party viewpoint we will analyze an article that economist Mike Schussler wrote for Netwerk24 to explain this scam to you. Schussler?s article is titled: \""Pension plan will impoverish old people\"". Schussler writes that in 2017 South Africa had 17 million individual pension accounts which was worth about R6,600 Billion at that stage. SA had one of the best pension systems in Africa and the world, but this pension saving system was setup and handed over by the previous NP government, not implemented by the ANC. This is a lot of money. The ANC gravy train has bankrupted the entire country and all its institutions and departments and municipalities, so the pensions are the last pot of gold left in the entire rainbow nation South Africa. Schussler notes that black South Africans own two thirds of this pension wealth, something which the ANC is not keen to mention because these facts don?t fit their narrative of never ending BEE requirements, in tenders and large business ownership (which just benefits the few politically connected cadres). Schussler writes that the average pension saver has invested R576 000 of his own money in his pension. This is of course not enough to retire in luxury and this is now the money that Ramaphosa and his Cosatu allies want to take 10% from, to throw in the Eskom bottomless pit. Schussler mentions data from BankserveAfrica that states that the average pensioner only has R5,531 available per month to pay all his or her needs. This will be less if Ramaphosa and the ANC?s plan becomes reality of taking 10% of pensions to bail out Eskom?s self inflicted corruption debt. Everyone would agree that impoverishing old people is a bad idea. And what for? To save a few thousand high paying jobs at Eskom? Schussler notes that the average Eskom manager ? and all analysts agree there are far too many ? earns more than R800,000 a year. They, including Ramaphosa himself, have been doing so for many years, resulting in them being able to build up investments (and this is not even mentioning the millions in bribe money and tender frauds many of them amassed). The many must finance the few says Ramaphosa and his SACP influenced ANC. This view is increasingly being supported by liberals in the media as well, ready as they always are to sell the average man out to the elite. Liberal journalists really are establishment puppets and soldiers. NASPERS is well know for co-towing to Communist Chinese Regime in its Tencent operation there, even handing over account details of activists to the Chinese regime. WHY IT IS A BAD PLAN TO \""INVEST\"" MONEY BELONGING TO THE AVERAGE PENSIONER IN BANKRUPT ESKOM? Schussler writes that the money does not belong to the ANC. The money belongs to pension holders who will struggle as it is to retire in a financially sound position according to the BankserveAfrica data. Schussler points out what bad pension investment growth can result in by using the Transnet Second Defined Benefit Fund as an example. He says that one of his former bosses at Transnet now lives in a garage of one of his children and that the average Transnet pension does not even cover the medical aid contribution of pensioners! Most Transnet pensioners died in absolute poverty and the few living ones are scraping by on scraps. Government did not help these pensioners either and most of them are now dead, without seeing a cent from the settlement reached after pensioners took the Fund to court. Transnet delayed the class action lawsuit deliberately for many years and in the end settled the case with the few remaining pensioners. Their paltry final offer to pensioners after the protracted legal battle was an additional R10,000 per year for 3 years for pensioners. That is that and it is still a pittance. Schussler further argues, correctly so, that pension funds have already done more than their share to put money into State entities, by placing about R2,100 billion into State bonds and bonds of State Owned Enterprises. Schussler also notes that you can?t throw good pension money after the bad Eskom. It will be rewarding incompetence and corruption and take the incentive away from SOE?s to fix themselves. To bail them out will be like sentencing a murderer by giving him a gun. Doesn?t work like that! Lastly Schussler points to the fact that Eskom hasn?t been fixed at all despite the fact that Ramaphosa says they will fix Eskom. For one thing the same type of crony procurement BBEEE deals are still in place at Eskom, especially when it comes to Eskom?s procurement of coal and diesel. Schussler writes that the price for coal that Eskom paid has risen with 195 % since 2008 whilst the price of export coal has only risen by 14 %. Why would this be if Eskom suppliers ? like the Guptas ? did not play the system? TO SUM UP, Ramaphosa, his ANC and their liberal friends in organized business want to take a haircut of pensions belonging to 11, 5 Million South Africans to save the jobs of about 15,000 well paid and mostly corrupt Eskom employees. Taking from the many to save the few. However all hope is not lost as Solidarity trade union has vowed to fight any such plans in court. We have seen how the ANC and its cadres can drag out court cases whilst executing their evil deeds and SA-News will be doing our best to expose them? ",sa-news,0
#Kakfontein Winnies Hometown of Brandfort Now a Classic Commie Sh*thole! Residents Property Flooded in Sewage but Municipal Managers Refuse To Help  Too Busy Plundering?,"It is a telling indictment of #TheAfricanWay when their own so called struggle heroes? hometown, is reduced to a sh*thole, councilors thumbsuck exorbitant utility bill amounts for residents, and money to restore the house Winnie lived in, is stolen! The situation has got so bad in Brandfort that the VF+ political party has laid a complaint against the despotic municipal manager of the Masilonyana municipality, which serves Brandfort, Theunissen and Winburg in the Free State. The \""executive\"" mayor is Kunatu Stephen Koalane. This desperate step comes after the property of a resident of Brandfort, Annemie Swanepoel, has been flooded in raw sewage for over 6 weeks. Swanepoel says that she has to keep her children inside to prevent them from becoming sick, and that she can?t transport pigs off her plot because they will then have to cross the sewage dam. She also fears that the hooves of her horses will rot because they are walking through the sewage. Not to mention that the sewage can kill her animals, including her dogs. Swanepoel says she has approached the municipal manager, Pule Tshekedi, multiple times but he has refused to help. Could that be because he is too busy plundering the public coffers or maybe he wants a bribe, or perhaps even racism? Armand Cloete of the VF+ says the they have visited the sewage pumping station, but it has not been working for years. Cloete says he has spoken to municipal contractors and they tell him that they won?t do any work for the municipality because the contractors don?t get paid for work done. Cloete says that even though the municipality was placed under administration by the provincial government, the situation has not improved. Cloete says Brandfort is regularly without water. Electricity cables are also being regularly stolen thanks to the impotent and incompetent cadre deployment police, and that means residents are left without power. Residents are being billed ridiculous amounts because the municipality can?t even, or don?t want to, work out the correct amounts residents have to pay, so they suck any amounts from their thumbs. Residents then refuse to pay which leads to the municipality not being able to generate an income to replace the money they plundered. Back in 2018 The Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) had requested in Parliament that the Minister of Water and Sanitation, Gigile Nkwinti, take action in the ongoing water crisis affecting Brandfort residents in the Masolinyana municipality, after they were without water for a whole month. The FF Plus? parliamentary spokesperson, Adv. Anton Alberts, officially requested Nkwinti to provide guidance in Masolinyana, where the Brandfort waterworks regularly encounter pump problems. Even left wing Netwerk24 has tried to contact the municipal manager, the mayor and the speaker of the municipality but not one answered their phones. The landline phones of the municipality are also out of order. This sad story of #TheAfricanWay is the story of most rural once beautiful towns being destroyed by the ANC with their communist ideology. ",sa-news,0
"Swindled Ratepayers Spend Half a Million a Month For 6 Klerksdorp Municipal Councilors, to Live Permanently in Guesthouse After Their Houses Were Burnt Down for Non-Delivery!","Minority forced to pay for those the majority elects! It is well known that municipal councilors in South Africa are earning an unrealistic monthly salary, plus perks and a pension plan to boot, even though their job is only part time! Despite their own incompetence in completing simple insurance forms, (or was it deliberate?), after protesters burnt down their houses for non delivery, which makes it all the more shocking, that the small Klerksdorp municipality (Matlosana Municipality), has now spent R3,3 Million since September 2019, to house 6 municipal councilors and their extended families in a guesthouse in Stilfontein! Corruption, laziness and looting seems to have become part and parcel of the position of Municipal councilor, they now only have to listen to complaints from the community, but not actually do anything about the complaints, and attend the occasional meeting, where most of them sit and eat buckets of KFC chicken, (definitely true for parties like the ANC and EFF), and scheme on how to plunder you the taxpayers further with corrupt tenders and collusion? The monthly amount being spent is R546,000 and still the end of this costly housing exercise is nowhere in sight. Mr Tonie Meiring, who is a Klerksdorp councilor himself, representing the Independent Taxpayer Association in South Africa, revealed all this, saying he estimates there are about 40 people in all who are part of the extended families of the councillors. Mr Meiring added that the municipality?s financial affairs are in chaos, but that is not surprising as it seems to have become an actual part of the ANC?s official municipal management strategy, it is so rife? Fact is, these councilors are now a dead loss to the community and a drain on the poor ratepayers who have to finance their lavish existence. We should also remember that especially rural towns in South Africa are poor, yet these numerous black cadre councilors lord it over these poor communities, pretending that they are royalty and should be treated like the Queen and company from Buckingham Palace. If you take these guys away for 5 years, nobody would actually know they were gone, such is the extent of their uselessness. Mr. Meiring says that the municipality claims that the riot insurer SASRIA would pay for damages to houses and the alternative accommodation, but that is just another lie from the councilors. The true situation is that SASRIA won?t pay anything because 5 of the 6 councilors did not provide full details of damages suffered before the required cut-off date of 7 October last year. Municipal policy also states that emergency accommodation in cases like this, can only be provided for a period of 2 months. Mr Meiring also says he is being ignored in the council and that the ANC, which is in power, plans to keep on paying for the guest house indefinitely #TheAfricanWay is a vicious downward circle. They majority vote for ANC criminals, the ANC criminals then steal from the minority taxpayers and do not bother delivering services, then the community gets unhappy and burns houses, councilors then stay in luxury and next election the black population vote ANC again. The madness will never stop. Business people don?t deliver goods to the municipality because the municipality don?t pay their accounts on time, if at all. The houses of the 6 councilors were burnt down during protest riots in September 2019 due to the fact that the black population was angry because the municipality and councilors did not deliver. Now the councilors stay in luxury and they still don?t deliver! To give you an insight into the corrupt dealings of the Matlosana municipality in Klerksdorp, in North West province, it got a new mayor 13th November 2018. The new mayor, who was a former council speaker, Washington Ntozini, was elected by some ANC councilors who colluded with opposition parties, during a special council meeting. This was after the removal of former mayor, Maetu Kgaile three weeks before, through a motion of no confidence sponsored by the EFF. The election of the new mayor was done against the ANC PTT?s directive which wanted to have Kgaile reinstated. A week later and the ANC got their way, and Maetu Kgaile was re-instated as Matlosana mayor after being removed four weeks earlier, following a vote of no confidence. The action saw ANC councilors joining the opposition in the motion? yes, it leaves ones head spinning? ",sa-news,0
"Elderly German Tourist Found Murdered on Margate Golf Course  No One is Safe Anymore, Anywhere, Anytime","An elderly German tourist was found murdered on Saturday, 7 March on a golf course in Margate, Kwazulu Natal. A spokesperson of ambulance service Netcare 911, Shawn Herbst, told the media that the man?s body was pointed out to them on the golf course, after they received a call around 14:30. Herbst said the man was assaulted and had head injuries and had died on the scene. A spokesperson of the Police later told the media that the German man was murdered by unknown persons. The lack of information provided by the Police does raise a number of issues. First and foremost it should be noted that there is access control at places like golf courses and it?s very unlikely that the German man was murdered by a fellow golfer. The typical golfers visiting South Africa are not cold blooded murderers, so the logical conclusion is that he was probably murdered by attackers who invaded from the outside, and wanted to rob and or kill someone. This, yet again, does show the world how dangerous South Africa has become, not only for its own people but also for foreign tourists. South Africa is the murder and rape capital of the world and there are daily reports about murders on innocent law abiding people by almost exclusively black males. People are also regularly attacked in places like beaches and public hiking trails. Just last week ago video footage of a German couple being robbed in Cape Town went viral. ",sa-news,0
VIDEO: #PongolaHero Good Guy With a Gun Saves 24 Lives and Prevents Massacre at Sports Bar in Pongola! Mainstream Media Silent?,"On Friday night, March 6, a potentially horrific incident took place in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, but two things stopped it. One, a good guy with a gun, and two, mainstream media are absolutely dead silent about it and the fact that a good guy with a gun prevented a potential massacre! The shooting occurred at a sportsbar at a rugby club in the Pongola area, when six black men in balaclavas, armed with pangas and firearms, burst into the bar and demanded that patrons get on the ground and started shooting? According to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Capt. Nqobile Gwala, about 25 members of the rugby club were inside the bar at the time, when all hell broke loose at around 22:30, with CCTV footage showing the six armed black men, who burst into the bar of the sports club in Pongola and demanded the customers and staff lay on the floor and then started shooting at them and hacking and beating them with their pangas. \""One of the customers was able to get his own firearm out and fired back. One of the attackers, who is allegedly in his 30?s, was shot dead. An unlicensed firearm and ammunition were found alongside the suspect, \""says Gwala. On hearing the return fire the remaining attackers fled the scene. Sadly, one of the customers, Shaun Matthews (30), had been shot in the thigh by the attackers and was taken to the hospital, where he later succumbed to his wounds. \""Charges of murder, attempted business robbery, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition are being investigated by Pongola SAPS,\"" spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said. If video does not load watch here: https://youtu.be/575Q4E3sRD4 Subsequently police have managed to capture two of the other suspects aged 20 and 26, believed to be responsible, as they tried to leave the country and cross the border into Swaziland. \""The Pongola detectives acted on an intelligence and in the early hours of Monday morning launched an operation aimed at tracing the suspects involved in the fatal shooting at a rugby club in Pongola over the weekend,\"" said Mbele. KwaZulu-Natal provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula said \""I am confident that the remaining suspects will be caught soon,\"" While the two apprehended suspects are expected to appear in the Pongola Magistrate?s Court, the Pongola community are in mourning and have asked that their privacy be respected. This was a totally barbaric attack and it illustrates how white South Africans are increasingly trapped in this country, with their houses as their prisons, because it is too dangerous to go out at night. No one is safe anymore and an attack by a black man is always imminent and around the corner. Luckily in this instance a good man with a gun stopped 6 barbarians with guns. No wonder then that the ANC is doing its best to disarm white people with guns in South Africa. Likewise the mainstream media are doing their damnedest not to praise the actions of the good guy? even Maroela Media, a so called Afrikaner outlet funded by Solidarity Union, used a picture of a white hand with a gun on their report, and their headline read: \""two dead after shooting at sportsclub\""! Literally insensitively lumping the attacker and the victim together! ",sa-news,0
EVERYONE Suffers from ANC Corruption & Looting  Water Pressure Being Cut by 20% in Three Provinces Due To Municipal Debts Caused By Corruption!,"The endemic, systematic and structural way of ANC politicians looting, as if there is no tomorrow, has resulted in water shedding in 3 provinces. This typical feed-at-the-trough subsistence approach, while there are still any funds left in the bank account, has now resulted in a bulk water provider ? Rand Water ? cutting the water pressure to 3 municipalities in 3 provinces. Yet still it seems they just cannot work out why Verwoerd is still smiling? Rand Water has informed 3 municipalities that they are going to cut the water pressure to them by about 20% from Monday, due to huge amounts of debt owed to them by these municipalities. This will of course result in lower pressure water coming out of taps which will also impact on things like businesses, domestic appliances and even fire fighting efforts, due to reduced water pressure available to firefighters. High lying areas could be left without water completely. The areas are Ngwathe municipality (Heilbron, Koppies and Parys), Govan Mbeki municipality in Mpumalanga (Evander, Secunda, Bethal) and Madibeng in North West (Brits). Ngwathe owes R5, 2 million to Rand Water, Govan Mbeki municipality in Mpumalanga owes an astronomical R 47 million, whilst Madibeng in North West owes R10,5 million. This announcement will especially come as a shock to Govan Mbeki municipality residents because their water pressure is already cut by 40% by Rand Water due to an account that is in arrears. Once again it is proven that Africans tend to live just for today and loot just for today, so are unable to build anything sustainable, making them totally unable to plan and provide a future, even for the current generation, much less for the following generations. It is simply a case of steal as much as you can as fast as you can while you can? or as the Africans themselves say: \""it is my turn to feast at the table\"". They are the perfect consumers, which is why globalists and multi nationals love them so much? ",sa-news,0
Racist Tender for Opening Prayer? Africans Make A Mockery of International Business & Governance Standards With Despotic Cronyism and Pay to Play!,"White prayer not allowed! Socialist social engineering and anti white BBEEE laws, in conjunction with plain and simple greed and avarice, have been pushed to the extreme in captured South Africa. Apparently following the letter of the BBEEE laws, it has come to light that the Mangosuthu University of Technology in Umlazi, Kwazulu-Natal has put out a tender for an opening prayer, scheduled for this past Friday. This bizarre incident is so weird that we must remind you that this is not fake news (See tender document below). What we are dealing with here is just the logical conclusion of what happens when some \""empowered\"" black official somewhere, follows the letter of the ANC?s strict racial laws which bars white participation in economic activity, related to any State or official organ. Prospective prayer givers had to hand in a BBBEE certificate with a tax certificate together with the application (they only follow the law when it suits them). It is not clear from the tender document what the cost of the tender prayer was, (dare we ask), but the advertisement does state that the Mangosuthu University is committed to its procurement policy on Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment. (In other words whites need NOT apply). This same ANC legislation is followed straight through from national government. Provincial and local government and the entire State sector complies with it. Anyone who even questions this system, which is actually just benefiting the few politically connected elites and those willing to pay kickbacks to those officials, are of course called racist by the ANC regime and liberal mainstream media. You might well ask yourself the question, where there not any volunteers willing to do a prayer for free at that meeting? What meaning would that prayer hold anyway, taking into account that the prayer giver was bought and that it was just another transaction for him or her. Dirk Hermann of Solidarity told Maroela Media that this incident is the logical conclusion of the ANC?s mechanical racial approach where racial formulas are worked out with a pocket calculator. He said it showed the absurd side of the ANC?s racial ideology and social engineering policies where they even racially classify those who are allowed to pray and those who may not. Mr Hermann also pointed to the corruption aspect of it and pointed out that money changed hands. And that for a prayer! The University backpedaled and said that they apologize for \""wrong communication\"" about the matter when contacted by the media, but did not deny what happened. And how can they deny it when the tender document is there for all to see? They only apologized because they were caught out, like little children. South Africa has become an Orwellian Big Brother idiocracy and kleptocracy combined with a deeply racist and criminal society, but yet still very indoctrinated and ideologically driven by ANC. Looting and ideological racial laws have become one and the same thing for the ANC. This is the same ANC that was enforced on South Africa by the liberal West and South Africa?s black majority. This ANC and its narratives of the hero ANC and the \""bad white man\"" are still kept in place by the international liberal world and its media, which are quick to enforce double standards. Our liberal mainstream media have much to answer for for elevating the communist ANC, and its leaders to hero status, when it was clear from the start that it had a very corrupt and violent extremist past.

#TheAfricanWay: SPCA Finds Five Animals Which Died of Hunger in ANCs Bloemfontein Zoo! No Food in Sight Yet The Scum Ride The BBBEE Gravy Train!,"Who is the animal? One really has to wonder who it is that should be behind the bars at the Bloemfontein Zoo, when they let defenseless, captive animals die of hunger, while they ride the affirmative action gravy train and rob the taxpayer blind! Yes, it?s heartless and cruel but hey, it is ignored because it is Mandela?s \""rainbow nation\"" which can do no wrong and is loved, and vigorously defended, by brainwashed liberals and mainstream the world over! The SPCA has discovered 5 dead animals which have died of hunger in the Bloemfontein Zoo. The SPCA could find no trace of food in the zoo and have determined that the poor animals had died of hunger. Inspector Tebogo Maswanganye, who works for the SPCA, found a buffalo, 3 Barberry sheep and an impala dead in their camps. There was no trace of food anywhere. The inspector also found Gemsbok, Eland and Waterbuck antelopes in one enclosure and all were so skinny that the ribs were showing through the skin. All the animals were listless and without energy. buffalo The inspector told Maroela Media that herbivores are animals that constantly grazes and even one day without food is torture to them. He said that the donkeys and impalas came running to them in the hope of getting food, and the impalas made a sound which he believes was a cry for help. The rhino?s, buffaloes and Barberry sheep were all so weak their mouths were hanging open. The buffalo?s hip bones were showing because of a lack of food and their hair was falling out due to a lack of nourishment. Masvanganye said that the reptile park was dirty, smelled bad and pitch dark because the power was off. There was also no water. The pigs had a bad skin rash and were not treated. Reinet Meyer, a senior inspector with the SPCA, said they immediately went to buy food to feed the hungry animals. The animals couldn?t wait to eat it all up. The SPCA also opened a criminal charge related to animal abuse with the Police (which is sure to go nowhere as the Police are the ANC, this is Africa). The SPCA said they will monitor the situation in future. Waterbuck Bloemfontein Zoo However it is not only the Zoo that has been left in bad repair, even the web page for the Zoo on the Official Manguang Metro website, has not been updated for over a DECADE as can be seen here ? it still talks about 2010 as a target date: Muangguang metro website Note how they have the cheek to brag that the Zoo was found in 1906? yet there is not even an official Facebook page for the Bloemfontein Zoo, but millions are spent on allegedly \""promoting tourism\""?

"#CadreDeployment Entire Intake of 1,000 JMPD Candidates Fail! Cannot Handle a Car or a Gun or Traffic! ANC Government Hires Voters to Roleplay, NOT Workers to Work!","It seems South Africans are not listening to the ANC regime. When an advert offering a job for potential JMPD candidates, required applicants to have a drivers licence, yet at the end of their 18 month training period, none of the successful recruits can handle either a car, or a gun, or traffic, there is a serious disconnect somewhere! What the ANC regime do, and what they say are THREE entirely different things! Yes, three, as everything the ANC says has a double meaning. Just when you think things can?t get any weirder in the ANC and Liberal World Order?s flagship MultiCulti \""Rainbow Nation\"", which in reality turned out to be a one sided Africanist kleptocracy, you get a news release that leaves you even more dumbfounded. You will actually have to hold onto your chair for this one, so be pre-warned! As even the liberal commentator Gareth van Onselen once admitted: South Africa is effectively an idiocracy. Even liberals get disillusioned sometimes, yet in order to stay true to their social circle, they steadfastly keep on supporting the multicultural concept of a borderless world devoid of identities. An idiocracy is a few steps down from a mediocracy, the position SA previously held. Next stop, as Malcom Tucker puts it in The Thick of It, is simply calling it a cluster f**k. Well Gareth, we have reached clusterf*ck level, so you will have to update that article of yours! The JMPD, (with its almost 100 % black personnel) tasked Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, JMPD spokesperson, to issue a media statement in which he made the following flabbergasting statement: THIS IS NOT FAKE NEWS! You are more than welcome to cross reference with any other news website. Wayne Minnaar, JMPDAccording to Sr. Supt Minnaar more than 1,000 new recruits who have just completed their college training of 18 months, had to be sent back to college, because it was found that they are currently unemployable, because they either can?t handle weapons, can?t drive, (despite the job advert requiring a valid licence), or they have an intense fear for Johannesburg?s busy roadways! (No, we kid you not). But then the job advert did say you must have a driving licence, it did not say you must be able to drive, so just print ot buy a licence right? That disconnect again. Are you listening yet? Yes, you might well ask yourself the question why it is that they applied for a position with the JMPD if they fear busy roads. And yes, you might also ask yourself the question why the JMPD could not teach basic firearm skills to trainees in 18 months. It?s not as if firing a gun is rocket science. Supt. Minnaar did not say how long the trainees, who have already been earning a salary, have to spend in college for their re-training. Supt Minnaar said there will be individual investigations to clarify what is the problem with each of the trainees. Apparently not even one of the specific intake passed the training course of 18 months, something that must certainly be some kind of record somewhere. Indeed it seems they still went ahead with the official \""passing out\"" parade, because as we all know, the African Despots love a good party to show off fake medals, and spend loads of taxpayers cash on! A veritable Mad Hatters Tea Party, or is that Mad Hatters Passing Out Parade? According to Supt Minnaar, the head of the academy will now decide how long the intake?s re-training will last. The recruits in question completed their training schedule at the end of last year. However, at the same time 1,085 new JMPD recruits were unveiled at the same ceremonial \""pass out parade\"" on 25 Nov 2019. Traditionally in the Western world, \""passing out parade\"" means to give the recruits or trainees their official pass, and thus far it appears JMPD have only managed to \""pass out\"" 332 new officers in 2017, after hosting two pass out parades in April and November of that year. Shhh? don?t tell mainstream media, they seem not to know? We should all know however, that to the ANC regime, and Africans in general, this civilization thing is all just role play. All just an excuse to give hard earned tax payers money to loyal layabout voters. Zuma himself admitted that corruption is a European thing, meaning that it was a white thing to call corruption bad ? in Africa it is a normal part of life. How many times does the ANC have to say \""Cadre Deployment\"" before you realise what they are saying? In fact, in 2017, a whopping 65,000 people applied for these 1,579 trainee positions in the JMPD. This despite the email address on the job advert not working! There was an insinuation on Twitter that the applicants came \""from their own ranks\"". There?s that disconnect again? JMPD Job advert As per the tweet below, the email was not working. David Potter is a DA Councilor and the low response to the tweets makes one question where the 65,000 applicants came from? Did they just import them from the ANC Youth League, or ANC party paid up membership \""in good standing\"", list for the Joburg area? TwitterJMPD job But here is the rub: The DA is firmly involved with this entire process and even bragged about the fake \""passing out\"" parade on their official website! As per this pic, they certainly seem to be taking themselves seriously, even though it is all just roleplaying? DA at JMPD passing out parade Are you listening yet? ",sa-news,0
"#GangsterFreeState AG Report Shows Ace Magashules Legacy Leaves Free State & Bloemfontein Reeling! Bankrupt, Under Administration & Still Wondering What, or Rather, Who, Hit it!","#AfricansNormalizingCrime ? Magashule?s Mafia network stripped Bloemfontein and the Free-State to the bone. The Auditor General?s (AG) report for the 2018/19 financial year, which reads like a crime novel, found that the Bloemfontein Metro had R2 BILLION wasted on corruption and spent R 268 Million more than it earned, and that it owes creditors R135 Million more than what it?s assets are worth. But it seems that?s all OK, because ANC stands for Africans Normalising Crime. While he has now moved on to much bigger questionable \""deals\"", as the current ANC Secretary General, the former Free State premier, Ace Magashule?s decade long leadership in the once prosperous province was characterised by \""mafia-style tactics of governing and rudderless leadership\"" from which many questionable business dealings and state capture arrangements emerged, according provincial Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Patricia Kopane. Magashule?s nickname in the underworld is Mister 10%, as he apparently extorts 10% commission for every corrupt government BEE deal he arranged for the province, even pocketing R230-million in kickbacks from an asbestos deal. Pieter-Louis Myburgh, whose book Gangster State, which caused a storm, illustrated a damning account of corruption under Magashule?s premiership, alleging that the province was the epicentre of the State Capture catastrophe. Will Bloemfontein ever recover, even in the unlikely event it is lucky enough to get responsible governance, as it is now technically totally bankrupt and it is also currently under administration? Currently it takes the municipality an average of 142 days to pay creditors. Many grants to the municipality by central government were only partially spent, amongst which the drought disaster grant which was only 58% spent and that was on unrelated expenses! The bankrupt municipality is in turn owed more than R1 Billion by the Free State Provincial Government. The AG also found the municipality is incapable of collecting debt, because it takes the municipality on average 314 days to collect debt. The AG also found Bloemfontein spent R 1,3 Billion on unapproved expenses, R17, 7 Million on fruitless and wasted expenses and R 855 Million on irregular expenses.

#BoycottNews24 Liberal News24 Editor Adriaan Basson Capitulates To ANC / COSATU Plan To Raid Your Pensions To Pay Eskoms Corruption & Mismanagement & Sowetos Unpaid Bill!,"One of the reasons left wing liberals are called snowflakes is because it does not take much to make them melt and give up any reason or principle, and like a snowflake hitting the warm ground, the controversial far left wing Editor of News24, Adriaan Basson?s feelings towards \""thousands of pensioners whose livelihood depends on the GEPF\"", quickly melted and turned into a callous \""We have run out of money and options ? pensions will bail out Eskom.\"" Seems for some reason Adriaan Basson now supports the plan to plunder your pensions! Far left liberal Adriaan Basson, changed his position on pension capture in little over 2 weeks: On 10 February, just before the budget speech, Basson wrote the following in a News24 column and we quote: \"" I do take issue with their opportunistic flirting with a plan that can only be to the detriment of the thousands of pensioners whose livelihood depends on the GEPF. I have tried and tried to see the value for the GEPF in taking over R250bn of Eskom?s debt, but have failed to figure it out. There is simply nothing in it for the pensioners \"". Yet, in his newest column published two weeks later, on 2 March, titled: \""We have run out of money and options ? pensions will bail out Eskom\"", snowflake Basson, not only waxes lyrical about Pravin Gordhan, who is a person who defends all the ANC?s policies, like crony BEE deals and zero contracts issued to white owned companies, and who calls a Cosatu representative one of the \""smartest people in the country\"", (never mind the fact that the guy is a raving communist), makes it clear that Adriaan has done a typical liberal somersault, and now has accepted, for whatever reason, not only the grabbing of Government Employee?s Pension Fund money to pay off Eskom?s corruption and mismanagement debt, but in fact the raiding of all private pensions. Basson also makes it clear that the ANC and Cosatu definitely have not dropped these plans to use pension money to pay Eskom corruption debt, and that they are continuing to work on this plan at Nedlac and other places. For those who still trusted liberals, would you now still do so considering the fact that Adriaan Basson, who is a known liberal and big hater of Solidarity and Afriforum, can change his position so radically in 2 weeks, and acts in such a spineless and unprincipled way? Pensions are not ANC money. The fact is it is private money, saved up by private people, using their own money, contributing every month to build up a pension for their old age. If people?s pensions are depleted it will not only mean grand theft on an industrial scale, but it will come down to a massive crime against all people, as it will mean their old age will be stolen and they will be forced to live in poverty when they become older and weaker. Luckily the people who Basson hates so much, the Solidarity movement, are still there to fight for your rights and pension because Basson has clearly capitulated to the ANC and communists. Anyone who has watched the direction Naspers as a whole, has taken ever since 1992, will know that as a weak and spineless weasel, Basson is right at home in Naspers, who happily lift their skirt to the highest bidder?

"#Kakfontein: Africans Will Let The Sewage Pump Get Stolen, Not Replace it as They Are Too Busy Stealing Themselves, and Then Live in The #Sh*thole it Creates!","#TheAfricanWay is when something as mundane, yet vital as a pump, is allowed to be STOLEN from the local sewage treatment plant and instead of replacing it, pump raw sewage into the field, causing a massive stink, posing a health risk, looking terrible and seeping through to ground water, which is needed by local farmers who have to drill boreholes to give water to their animals. This is exactly what the Nala municipality in the Free State ? Bothavillle and Wesselsbron ? is doing. The local VF+ political party has now laid criminal charges against the acting municipal manager at the Wesselsbron Police station, in terms of the Water Act, Act on Waste Management and National Environment Management Act. As in the case of most ANC Municipalities, it seems the Municipal officials were to busy stealing themselves to do their actual jobs, and that corruption was their primary activity, as the Nala Municipality manager, Buti Piet Molupi, was arrested for security tender fraud a few weeks ago. The Hawks claimed that there is enough forensic evidence to prove that Molupi contravened Section 173 of Municipal Finance Management Act. Molupi appeared before the Bothaville Magistrate?s court and was granted R5,000 bail. The case has been postponed \""to 21 May 2020 for a Serious Commercial Court date.\"" Tsupa, a former municipal manager; Mofokeng. the municipality?s chief financial officer; Matjele, the director of public safety; and Molefe the manager at supply chain department within the municipality, are also currently out on R10 000 bail. \""The municipality reportedly lost almost R700 000 as a result of an alleged irregular, wasteful and fruitless expenditure,\"" the Hawks revealed. It is believed that Molupi, along with four senior government officials (Robert Tsupa, 46, Abraham Moratwe Mofokeng, 47, Mabidikwana Wilfred Matjele, 61, Nkgaudise Nelson Molefe, 39) and the director of Zero Tolerance Warnic Montsitsi, colluded in a shoddy tender deal worth R700 000. Analysis: The laying of criminal charges might let some people believe that something will now be done by black officials of the municipality, but that is very unlikely. Accountability is very hard to pin down in ANC?s South Africa and even Court processes are notoriously cumbersome and fraught with obstacles and yes, even corruption. For example, SA-News recently reported on the widespread environmental damage and sewage pollution caused by the Randfontein municipality. In that case a criminal case was laid against the municipal manager 4 years ago and in that 4 years the pollution has just got worse. It is also remarkable how activists from the white minority, a minority which is under constant attack by black fascists and criminal parties like the ANC and EFF, are actually the ones trying to do something to prevent things like sewage pollution. Where are black activists in this regard? Don?t they mind to live in filth? Community activists fighting pollution are always white. Is it only white people who don not want to live in filth? What we do see from the black population however is the classis protest manipulated by political agitators, where locals have been agitated to embarked on a total shutdown, to demand better services in general from the Nala Local Municipality. Residents have disrupted schools in the Monyakeng township. Shops belonging to foreign nationals have also been looted. Once again shooting themselves in the foot. The sewage pump however does not get mentioned nor is it replaced? it is also quite likely the protests themselves were arranged by the ANC! It does seem like an impossible task to fight #TheAfricanWay style of rot and decay. Who needs more evidence that the black rulers of South Africa will totally destroy this once beautiful country and run it completely into the ground? ",sa-news,0

"R2.2 BILLION Stolen From Street Cleaner Budget! ANC Uses Government as Redistribution of Wealth Scam, But Leaders Steal Cash Meant For The Workers, Then Demand More Money!","Redistribution of Wealth is an altruistic term created by Socialists to lure liberals from their cash, and this system has been turbocharged in SA. Unfortunately, they money very rarely filters down to those that need it, as the corrupt leaders and elites invariably intercept and steal the money. In yet another example of this two decade long plunder, it has been revealed that an amount of R2,2 Billion is simply missing, and unaccounted for, that was allocated by the National Department of Co-operative Governance, headed by Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, to a Community Works Program which was operated by private contractors and tenderpreneurs. This is the program redistributing wealth, (employing) a total of 250,000 people from communities on a part time basis to clean the streets. You most likely have seen those people, sometimes old gogo?s ( grandmothers), standing or lying around with their green reflective vests, occasionally popping a piece of rubbish into a blue bag. This is the #TheAfricanWay when it comes to job creation. Just an excuse to take taxpayer?s hard earned money and give it away for nothing. Socialism 101. They pay 250,000 people, part time, to clean up after their own kind, who simply throw rubbish out of taxis and sometimes next to existing rubbish bins, not in it. It does not seem logical? Paying so many people to pick up rubbish just so that others can throw more rubbish on the ground. But that is socialism, it is all about creating ways to give away other people?s money. One worker fills the wheelbarrow, the next empties it, and then it is filled with the same sand by the first worker again? Now the Auditor General has found in its latest report that R2,2 BILLION allocated to this program is simply gone, and can?t be accounted for. Despite this latest Auditor General finding, of funds going missing, a massive R13 BILLION is now earmarked for this commie sounding \""Community Works Program\"" for the next 3 years. The Department responsible for overseeing municipalities ? Department for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), managed by Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, is totally dysfunctional and just another place where looting is happening on a grand scale. According to Rapport, this is made clear by the Auditor General (AG) in his annual report, where, besides finding that R2,2 Billion is unaccounted for, the Auditor General states that no finding can be made about the Department?s financial year report because, like last year, the AG can?t find any proof for claims made in the Annual Report. The AG has found that some of the payments made by the Department to contractors in the Public Works Programme was to non existing ghost participants, and in some cases to people who are already deceased! Despite all this ineptitude, corrupt officials of the Department gave themselves bonuses of R 4 Million! So if you are wondering why South Africa is so dirty, despite government paying 250,000 people to be part time street sweepers and cleaners from a Community Works Program, just remember TheAfricanWay?

"#CoronoVirus Officially in Africa As Nigeria & Algeria Confirm Cases While South Africa Plans Return of 132 Students From Wuhan in Hubei Province, China!","Most would agree that it is almost certain the #CoronaVirus is already in Africa, as the ability is just not there to detect it, but now Algeria and Nigeria have officially confirmed cases of infection. There are 199 South African citizens, mostly students, in Wuhan City and 132 of them have asked to be repatriated back to SA. As they?ve been living under lockdown conditions since the outbreak of the coronavirus a few weeks back, Ramaphosa can rest easy that it is a fairly safe endeavor for his troubled reputation. Dr. Anban Pillay ? Director General at the Department of Health stated 3 weeks ago that if anyone was infected they would not be repatriated. Only two days after Algeria had reported its first confirmed case of the new coronavirus, an Italian man who arrived in Algeria on February. 17 and had been put into isolation, Dr Osagie Ehanire from The Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria confirmed the coronavirus (Covid-19) case in Lagos State Nigeria via his Twitter. The case which was confirmed on 27/02/2020 is the first official case to be reported in Nigeria since the beginning of the outbreak in China in January this year. According to the NCDC, the patient is clinically stable and is being managed at the Infectious Disease Hospital Yaba. The patient is also an Italian national returned to Nigeria where he works and has been placed in isolation. There are also reports of a man who returned from Beijing after Chinese New Year, and a women who was shopping in China while there on business ? they were on the same flight and are quarantined at a Lagos private hospital. In the last two days the virus has suddenly spread in various countries with new clusters in South Korea, Italy, Singapore and Japan. It has killed over 2,850 people, mainly in China according to official figures, although many experts suggest it is far more. There are 83,357 infections worldwide, once again officially, but it is almost certainly twice that, depending on the level and threshold of testing. The 199 South African citizens in Wuhan City have been living under the state imposed lockdown conditions since the outbreak of the virus, and have been waiting weeks for news about repatriation, yet it is still not clear when it will actually be effected. They received an official letter this week informing them that it will happen, but no details of when or how. According to one student there, the Chinese government still have to make arrangements and back in South Africa they are still searching for suitable accommodation, where they will be quarantined for a further 21 days as a precaution. So SA are certainly not in a rush as they will remain in quarantine, be it in China or SA, we just hope that in the process of the transfer, contamination does not occur?",sa-news,0
"For 21 Years ANC Promised Flagstaff Running Water At Every Election, Yet Still Flagstaff Waits & Still Flagstaff Votes 84% ANC!","The residents of the Eastern Cape town of Flagstaff are very discouraged after trying everything possible for two decades to get the ANC to deliver promised tap water to their homes. Well that is everything except voting for another party. It is astounding that black South Africans continue to vote for ANC, despite two decades of failed governance and broken promises. Flagstaff which is 96% black African and 90% Xhosa speaking, voted 84% for the ANC in 2016! However voters are given no viable alternative because ANC and EFF work so hard to demonise minorities and stoke anti minority racism amongst the black majority. In 1998 the ANC government made promises to the town that running water would be available to them, but the residents had to contribute R10 per household for the taps that each house would receive. The villagers were told to make the once-off contribution of R10 per household and with zeal, the R10 contributions were quickly collected and paid to the ANC government, and now, after 21 years, the residents are still waiting for the day that water will be brought to their homes. Gogo, who was born in the village, a spokesmen for residents, says each time with an election the local Ingquza Hill Local Municipality council ANC candidates promise them tap water, but it has never materialised. He says four water pipes have been laid underground but are not in use. Flagstaff residents are told that tap water is high on the agenda for the town, but so far nothing has happened. When the villagers enquire at Ingquza about the matter they are referred to OR Tambo District Municipality. According to OR Tambo District Municipality communications manager, Zimkhitha Macingwane, owner of Ludumo Trading was appointed to install 80 taps 5 years ago, but that has still not been completed even though millions have been spent.

Not Just Whites Fleeing SA  Wits Vice Chancellor Leaving Wits & South Africa for UK. Adam Habib Sites Pressure From Corrupt Elites Demanding Preferential Treatment For Children as Reason!,"The brain drain and exodus from South Africa is not just whites fleeing, as mainstream media would have you believe. Even non white liberals like Wits University Vice Chancellor, Adam Habib, has announced his resignation from Wits and says he is also leaving South Africa, to settle in England, where he will have to survive without a BEE crutch. Among the reasons he sites the shocking experiences from students? parents who \""offer to do something\"" for him if he lets their children be admitted to medical school and he looks after their child once admitted. He also warned that the lawlessness had made him uncomfortable, and that left-wing extremists as well as conservative elements were destroying him, although we are not sure which \""right wing\"" elements have been disrupting Universities? He says these were just a few examples of the experiences he had at Wits, and in his seven years of service at the university he often had to take into account many unpleasant matters. This is not surprising given how Universities have become politicized hotbeds for civil unrest and violent agitation from marxist and far left wing elements in society. However he says the team under him stood strong and did not comply with the many requests and demands they received, and that they rather defended the university?s integrity. As usual, it is nothing new for liberals to flee a country once their liberalism has destroyed it. Many black South Africans are also claiming asylum in the West, after they have effectively destroyed SA.",sa-news,0
"If Rape is A Tool Of War, Then #FarmAttacks ARE WAR! Grandfather Murdered and ALL 5 Females Raped, Including 3 Primary School Girls in Limpopo Farm Attack!","ARCHITECTS OF APARTHEID: Just when libtards try bestowing the virtues of Africans to you, news comes out of this extremely horrific and serious farm attack which happened on January 15, this year, which was not even reported on by any mainstream media. Names in the report are withheld because 3 small children were raped. As the pic above shows, this kind of horror is openly discussed amongst blacks? This incident only came to light now via a small community publication, the Kempton Express, to who this horrific story was narrated by a local Kempton Park resident. Why was it not reported on by mainstream media? Did Police deliberately hope to keep it quiet? Understandably the man who narrated the story did not want himself fully identified because then the Primary School girls who were raped, would be identified, because they are all his cousins. The story as told to the local community publication is that on January 15, a local Security Pros control room operator, *Pieter (21), received a call from his uncle informing him of a horrific farm attack in the early morning hours near Polokwane. Pieter, a Glen Marais resident, said there were four black male suspects who struck on the farm of his grandfather (69) about 25km from Polokwane. Peter said that his granddad, grandmother (63), aunt and three young cousins were all on the farm during the time of the attack. The attackers tied up the entire family and all the women were raped. Pieter?s cousins are all in primary school. The youngest will turn seven later this year. Pieter said that his granddad tried going for his gun when one suspect sliced a deep gash in his right side with a panga. They took R1,500 cash and jewelry. Pieter?s grandfather was rushed to hospital where he died on January 24 after suffering a heart attack. Pieter?s grandmother and 3 young cousins received trauma care and spent two nights in hospital. The attackers got away and police are still investigating. Pieter?s widowed grandmother and other female relatives went to live with family until further arrangement could me made. This attack shows the brutality of farm attacks in South Africa and the reality of the slow war. There was also another horrific incident on 29 January near Bapsfontein, Gauteng when Timothy Rademeyer (51) and his wife Dirkie Voges were attacked on their farm. The couple was seriously assaulted and Timothy?s genitals were mutilated. Dirkie crawled outside where a motorist discovered her in the road. He then called a paramedic. ",sa-news,0
"Deliberate Losses: Affirmative Action & BEE, A Scam That Bankrupted an Entire Country & ALL its State Owned Enterprises! Allowed To Steal Tons of Cash Just For Being Black, Not For Adding Any Value!","Never before has there been as big a fraud perpetrated upon hardworking taxpayers than that which the majority black population has perpetrated upon South Africa. Imagine you know someone high up at a state owned utility, and because you are black, (and probably an ANC member too), you can add a 10% markup to the SOE?s services or product price and then have that 10% paid into your bank account. You then sit back and the money rolls in. By selling your blackness, to the utility to give it affirmative action credibility, you become a billionaire? you don?t work, you just steal. This nationwide fraud is institutional, structural and even official and is akin to legalised plunder! Like making something legal that was previously illegal, like marijuana was, defrauding the state has become legal in ALL its departments and State Owned Enterprises. It has become the norm, not the exception. Despite the fact that last year Cyril Ramaphosa, pirate in chief, declared the state coffers are empty ? that there is nothing left to plunder, they have not stopped plundering. The thing is they have the perfect cover ? just say the magic word \""apartheid\"" to any one who dares question what you are doing! Why do you think Malema and Ramaphosa went to such great lengths at SONA to distract everyone?s attention away from their crimes with ancient, revisionist apartheid history? As the well in the treasury dried up years ago, bailouts started becoming the norm to feed this wholesale defrauding of the state and its helpless captured taxpayers. This is how the Selling goods for less than marked-up \""cost\"" price scam works: SAA for instance will pay black middleman \""suppliers\"" R90 for a bottle of water that can be bought in the store for R10. But the same bottle of water is sold to SAA customers for a reduced price of maybe R40. How can this be you ask? Simple. As we all know, SAA runs at a loss and we the taxpayers bear the loss. They are literally stealing direct from us by deliberately running at a loss. So the actual purchase price + markup for black middleman 1 + markup for black middleman 2 + markup for kickback for insider = SAA final purchase price. Which is then sold at an artificially manufactured loss! Several black \""BEE\"" companies siphon off or skim off their bounty, WITHOUT doing anything or adding any value at all. Mostly, the black middlemen companies do not even have premises. Everything is just book entries as they spend and spend, while their bank accounts grow without lifting a finger. The reason is not BEE or affirmative action or even transformation, that is just the excuse and cover. It is plain simple greed and criminality. In fact this was clearly laid out, as we reported in the case of SAA buyer Nontsasa Memela: Nontsasa MemelaAs there aren?t any pure black companies that have the technical knowledge and ability to manufacture and supply spare parts for aircraft, (or whatever other thing are required in other State Owned Enterprises), spare parts can only be bought from a place like America for instance. But a so called lack of \""transformation\"" is the flimsy excuse used by black people like Nontsasa Memela, to implement their African style of fraud and shenanigans, setting up and employing third party black middleman companies, who are then attached to the real supplier in America, in a joint venture. So they can then claim the supplier is a black owned company, when in fact it is still the whitey in USA or wherever. Remember state owned enterprises are not allowed to do business with white men. Could this be the reason the law was brought in despite its obvious racism? The third party black middleman is just a shell and does not have to have real experience or manufacture anything or even have premises. They are the black cover or figleaf who can skim money off transactions and give kick backs to SAA or SOE executives. And this is exactly how it was. SAAT in 2016 awarded a contract to JM Aviation ? the black figleaf ? and AAR ? the actual American supplier ? to supply aircraft parts for 5 years. JM Aviation through its director, Vuyisile Ndzeku, then contributed R2, 5 million towards the building of Memela?s new house in Bedfordview (the kickback). Ndzeku is also the owner of Swissport, who had another 2 tenders with SAAT. Shalk Human, who also worked at SAAT, testified before the Zondo commission that this Swissport was appointed by SAA and SAAT to supply ground management services. Until 2016 there was no contract signed. In 2016 a contract was signed with Swissport but there was no tender process followed. There was one particular very funny and corrupt transaction about which Human testified, he was not the one who implemented it, Memela and her fellow black executives did. SAA bought power units worth R 9 million from Swissport who then sold the same parts at half the price to JM Aviation. Both companies of course had the same owner ? Ndzeku, who was Memela? s partner in BEE crime. JM Aviation then sold the power units back to Swissport who then rented it to the SAA. The guy in charge of SAAT at the time was Yakhe Kwinana. Another witness before the Zondo commission testified that Kwinana wanted bribe money paid to him in exchange for a tender worth R100 million for aircraft parts. Eskom corruption Another example is Bloemfontein municipality buying an Armored Riot Vehicle which they did not need, and had no staff for, with 2 Million added on to the price by the black middleman. Or there is the case of paying 28 times more for a piece of undeveloped land, so as to plunder a Pension Fund So now the bailouts are drying up and even banks are refusing to lend money to the corrupt bankrupt plunderers of the state. The African locusts are moving on and have this deluded communist idea that somehow stealing the property of white people, without compensation, is going to allow their fleecing party on the gravy train to hell to continue. Sadly, no one will be buying this land and like Comrade Lenin discovered to his peril, you cannot feed land to people, so they are in for a terrible shock. But SA soon becoming an international humanitarian crisis is another story. In fact it is so bad even the banksters have been caught out by the African locust feeding frenzy (and their own greed for interest), and they are now proposing we plunder the pensions of citizens to try rescue the now bad loans THEY made to State Owned Enterprises and banks. Who knows, like China they too might soon take over over assets and property in lieu of the debt. Gwede mantashe corruption The globalist elites, especially amongst the far left white commies, will try tell you this is creating a wealthy and middle class amongst the \""previously disadvantaged\"" black population, but they underestimated the avarice of the African. Africans will burn through money and consume like a wildfire on the plains in gale force winds. They do not save or invest or build. Just consume. The Bantu have consumed the entire sub- Saharan Africa! This is why globalist industrialists and multinationals love black people ? they are the perfect consumer, who love brand names, do not complain about quality and spend most of their money on disposable goods ? the perfect golom with which to create eternal profit. Blacks also breed more consumers much faster than whites. Oh yes, and when they do actually work, the wages are low too? South Africa is not a failed state ? it is a plundered state. Until there are investigations into every single state supplier and whether they actually add value, nothing will change. ",sa-news,0
"The Rainbow Nation Turns Romantic Valentines Day Holiday into a Nightmare for Dutch Couple as Black Males do Their \""Thang\""!","Yet more foreigners have discovered that South Africa is now a dangerous sh*thole and not a safe place to visit, after they were robbed at gunpoint by 2 black males on a Safari farm. Tommaso Bordoni (29) from Belgium and the love of his life Linsey de Waele (25) from the Netherlands came to South Africa for a romantic Valentine?s vacation? Sadly, and predictably, what should have been a perfect Safari Valentine?s day turned into a nightmare as the couple became victims of armed robbers. Tomasso thought that his last day on earth had arrived after the cold steel of a firearm was pressed against his head and the blade of a knife against his throat. After a day on safari on a guest farm in Addo in the Eastern Cape, the couple was relaxing in their room for the evening on 14 February. It was then that 2 black males came into the room just before midnight, one with the firearm and one with the knife. Tomasso pleaded for his life. Luckily Linsey was in the bathroom at that stage where she kept hiding. The attackers took the cash, clothes and passports of the couple and forced Tomasso at gunpoint to point out their hired vehicle. The attackers had trouble starting the hired car and Tomasso ran away in the dark. He met a hysterical Linsey on the way and together they ran to another guest house for help. The Police responded but no arrest was made. The couple was supposed to fly back last Sunday but had to spent the past week in Cape Town whilst waiting for new passports. They flew back home on Friday, hopefully to warn their fellow countrymen not to listen to Cyril Ramaphosa and to avoid Socialist South Africa? hand gun farm murder ",sa-news,0
"Another Elderly Nigel Man, Deon Botha (72), Killed For No Reason While Tending His Garden, By Black Male Fleeing Scene of Another Crime!","The disproportionate slaughter of whites by black males continues in SA. In the youngest incident Deon Botha (72) who has been described as a religious and loving person, was shot in the chest and killed by a black criminal fleeing another crime, while \""Oom Deon\"" was innocently standing in his front garden in Nigel on Thursday morning, 20 February 2020. Not a day goes by that another white person, if not more, are murdered by a black man in South Africa. White people who stay in South Africa live in fear, barricading themselves, locking everything they can, staying indoors out of fear. In almost all cases black males are the perpetrators. The young black male killer of Deon Botha had first stolen a firearm and jewelry at the house of another elderly man in Bloekom street and when a woman from a nearby kindergarten saw him running away, she chased him with her vehicle down Violet Street. When she confronted him, the black male then threatened the lady following him with the firearm, and ran to Tulp street, where he shot Oom Deon who was busy in his front garden, apparently for no reason. Quintin Joubert, a member of Nigel?s Community Police Forum (CPF), who found Oom Deon?s body, said the attacker initially ran through the yard of the kindergarten near Botha?s home. After shooting Botha, the attacker then fled the scene of the murder, leaving behind the stolen items from the first robbery. These were found inside a bag by the police on the murder scene at Botha?s home. A family friend told Netwerk24 that Oom Deon?s wife passed away 8 months ago, but that Oom Deon was still a very active person. Botha lived with his son, daughter and grandchild. As SA-News reported, another elderly Nigel resident, Mr Hans van Rooyen (83), was also murdered in his home in Nigel in November last year, and his car stolen by his attackers, but it is not known if Oom Deon was murdered by the same attacker. A member of the neighbourhood watch saw black males leaving with Mr Van Rooyen?s car from his house, he followed it but the car overturned and the attackers ran away into the black township Alrapark. When the Police visited Mr Van Rooyen?s house they found him dead. He was tied up and badly assaulted before being murdered. ",sa-news,0
"Small-scale White Farmer & Friend Executed With Hands Tied & Throats Slit Near Maclear, Eastern Cape! Three Black Males Arrested.","Why would so called \""robbers\"" gruesomely slit the throats of someone already neutralized with their hands tied? The names of the 2 white farmers who were found murdered on a smallholding at Maclear in the Eastern Cape, have been released. They were Eugene Peter du Plessis (54) and Sidwell Pepper (44). Du Plessis was the owner there and farmed on a small scale and Pepper was a friend who was visiting him. They were found with hands tied and throats slit on Monday by Police members who went there to investigate after they were informed by neighbours that Du Plessis was last seen alive last week. Police discovered a gruesome scene and there were signs of horrific violence. Police had to force the door of the house open before discovering the bodies. Police made 3 arrests in connection with the murder on the same day. A TV set and cash were found in the possession of the accused. Police say they suspect the motive was house robbery, but once again, why would \""robbers\"" gruesomely slit the throats of someone who has their hands tied and are already neutralised? The 3 accused Andile Poni (40), Nkosivumile Mrwetyana( 40) and a 17 year old youth appeared in court but the case was postponed.",sa-news,0
"ANC, EFF & Mainstream Media Are Literally Painting Targets on The Backs of Whites With Their Obsessive, Yet Hypocritical \""White Man Evil, Black Man Good\"" Globalist Lies!","\""A CORRUPT ANC IS FAR WORSE THAN APARTHEID\"" We have yet to hear a single black politician explain to their voters that \""Kill The Farmer, Kill The Boer\"", is just a metaphor and not to be taken literally, as if it were an instruction! Why? Why is the daily slaughter of whites by blacks allowed, justified, ignored and even denied? We examine this deliberate creation of a twisted narrative, which is well funded, institutional and structural. The more the ANC?s criminal nature, incompetence and large scale looting is revealed, the more the ANC needs to keep the narrative in place that all land was stolen by whites and that Apartheid was somehow a crime against humanity. This of course is to distract the masses from their crimes and to keep the black majority support. The ANC, supported by liberal media, is deliberately creating the notion that whites are evil thieves, against who the black majority needs to be protected. This perception leads to a sort of justification amongst the black majority, the international community and even many whites who naively believe the mainstream narrative, that it is ok to murder and rob whites. This tactic of polarising and militarizing people is exactly the same communist tactic the ANC used that brought them to power in the first place ? they do not know any other way, even after 25 years. It is really a case of the prisoners who are now running the jailhouse. A target is literally being painted on the white community?s backs and this has been happening for decades. As an example, it should be remembered how the ANC MP Duduzile Promise Manana shouted \""Bury them alive\"" in Parliament, referring to white farmers, when Dr Pieter Mulder of the VF+ initiated a debate on farm murders in 2017. This narrative ? and Cyril Ramaphosa is a good example of a man speaking in narratives and code ? is being used by the ANC ? and accepted by the international liberal world and liberal media ? to justify the suppression of minority rights. Of course the Courts, including the Constitutional Court, are just an extension of the ANC regime and ideology and it is after all the ANC that appoints the judges, so their opinion is worthless. The regular and constant attacks on whites also leads to the white minority ? who are really the ones who should care most ? being left numb and inevitably putting their heads deeper into the sand, because they are unable to deal with the incomprehensible situation anymore. It defies all logic. Establishment Kills the farmer Because the ANC, with the help of the Liberal World Order, are so good at rewriting and twisting history, they, as the victors, own the narrative of the absolute evilness of apartheid and whites in general, and that in turn seems to lead to a situation where the international community don?t seem to care about the large scale farm murders, and general onslaught against the white minority. The ANC narrative is strengthened in various ways, for instance school history books and captured courts. Now that the ANC completely revised the history and the narrative of the day, they felt safe to implement expropriation without compensation, being a communist policy that all land must be in state ownership. If the white minority and especially Afrikaners want to reverse the trend of slow extermination of their ethnic group, they will have to do more to stand together in a true movement so that resources can be pooled to better represent and protect them. In this regard it is important to remember that liberal media will always take the ANC?s side for financial reasons, and all major mainstream media houses in South Africa were already captured by the ANC, and black elites supporting them, so it will be vital for the white minority to support their own media platforms, like SA-News & SAUK Nuus, that gives their perspective and tells their stories.

"Afriforum Release Their Moderate Version of Farm Murder Statistics For 2019, Showing a 27% Increase in Daily Attacks! Defend & Protect Yourself  The Black Majority Regime Will Not!","Afriforum have released their version of 2019 farm attack statistics which can be taken as a minimum, given their moderate conservative approach and it only includes attacks reported to them. However, despite this, it still shows a clear increase in the slow war and genocide on whites and even farm workers are affected. The Afriforum statistics of farm murders and attacks for the 2019 year shows that farm attacks have increased yearly from 2011 with altogether 552 farm attacks that were reported to Afriforum in 2019. This represents a 27% increase from the 433 farm attacks reported in 2018. Lorraine Claassen, an analyst with Afriforum, says the most farm murders were in the Free State last year, a total of 11. The numbers of farm murders in the Free State have risen considerably in the last 3 years but still altogether 30% of farm attacks last year occurred in Gauteng. Claasen explains that criminals can attack multiple smallholdings like those in Erasmia and Muldersdrift in one night because they are close together. Claasen says that 905 people were affected by attacks on farms and smallholdings last year. In 26% of farm attacks there was a definite attempted murder involved. Murders were committed in 9% of farm attacks and rape in 3% of farm attacks. There were an average of 1,1 farm murders per week and 1,5% farm attacks per day in 2019. The average number of attackers per incident was 3. According to Claasen most farm attacks involved forced entry by for instance breaking down doors or burglar bars and most farm attackers came with a vehicle (which will make patrols of rural roads essential as the Police are not doing it). Theo de Jager, head of agricultural body Saai says in 26% of cases farm workers were also the victims of attacks. Ian Cameron of Afriforum points out that the statistics show that it is clear that the South African Police and government are unable or unwilling or both to protect farmers and farm workers and that farmers will have to defend themselves (so pls start to carry the firearms you have and not always keep it in the safe from where the criminals will take it if they surprise you in your bed). Just this week it was reported that the bodies of 2 men, aged 50 and 54 were found on a smallholding at Maclear in the Eastern Cape. Their hands were tied and throats slit. Their names have not been released. ",sa-news,0
Gauteng Chocolate Firm Told He Employs TOO MANY Black Women! ANCs Sexist Race Based BEE Laws & Representivity Policy is Social Engineering at its Communist Worst!,"A Belgian chocolate manufacturer in Gauteng was left dumbfounded when he was told by the Department of Labour, that he employs too many black women! In good old Communist tradition, the ANC Employment Police from the Department of Labour, which are trying to enforce the ANC regime?s strict national demographic racial quota system (aka representivity), for the workplace, has struck at a family business in Kempton Park which manufactures Belgian chocolate. The raid has left the owner of the business, Mr Kees Beyers, dumbfounded after the Department of Labour inspector, Thabo Masenya, told him that he employs too many black women. No this is not fake news! This actually happened! Mr Beyers, who was born in Belgium, began the family business making chocolate more than 30 years ago in South Africa. He initially came to work for his sister and liked the country so much that he decided to stay and start his own business. Today Beyers Chocolate employs more than 400 people, and three quarters of them are black women. One would have thought that that kind of commitment to employing \""previously disadvantaged\"" females would earn him praise, but no, it is with these black women that the ANC?s Department of Labour has a problem. Labour inspector Thabo Masenya has warned the business after his recent visit, that the business can only employ a total of 36, 2% of black women, because that is the racial demographics of Gauteng. Mr Beyers has told Rapport that if his business does not comply, the Department has threatened to take him to the Labour Court. Whether the Labour department?s statistics are correct is also questionable, because the ANC and their officials are not known to count too well either, and this is proven by the second problem the inspector had. Yes, there is more! Inspector Masenya has also questioned why Mr. Beyers employs a black Zimbabwean engineer, because, wait for it, he says Department of Labour stats says that the racial demographics shows that there are 0% Zimbabweans and other foreigners in Gauteng. Any Gauteng resident will confirm that this is an outright lie! Where are the liberals and their open borders agenda now? The problem seems to have started in 2018 when the business had to complete a submission to the Department of Labour, setting out what is the racial make up of their list of employees. Did all businesses in Gauteng have to do this? This led to a meeting with the Department of Labour in November last year. It was in this meeting that the Department of Labour informed the management that they have a problem with the fact that the business employs too many black women. Lize Arnott, the human resource manager of Beyers Chocolates, explained to Rapport that the nature of the work is such that females are better at it. The work entails fine work like the tying of ribbons and men don?t apply for the job as much as women do. Arnott says that they then invited Inspector Masenya to come see conditions for himself, but when they invited him to take a walk on the work floor, the snobby Masenya became aggressive and threatened them with the Labour Court. He also accused Beyers Chocolate of being \""non transforming\"". Can anyone imagine the complications if Beyers Chocolate only employed poor white female workers? Yes, there are more than enough of them around willing to work for even lower wages, thanks to the oppressive BEE laws. This in reality is the crux of the matter though. ANC?s racist and sexist BEE laws give most BEE points when you hire black women, so obviously many businesses in SA do just that, artificially creating a Black Female Privileged class. So in essence the ANC has shot itself on the foot here, as communism usually does and they do not like it when a white guy benefits from their own racism? because white guys are at the very bottom of the BEE scale. If this makes you feel uncomfortable, just repeat the lie that we are all the same to yourself? Beyers chocolate When contacted by Rapport, the chief director of Labour in Gauteng backed up Masenya?s actions, saying Beyers Chocolate can \""transform\"" by for instance natural employee turnover. But Arnott says their employees are happy and stay with them for a long time. They don?t have high turnover at all. Soon will come the day when a Stasi citizen force will be setup and your neighbour will be rewarded for informing on you, like happened in communist East Germany before the fall of the Communist Iron curtain. One wonders how this little chocolate factory came to the attention of the regime in the first place? Was it really just because they filled in a form? Or does the guy just want a bribe? For the record, the ANC government is also supposed to be enforcing the same national racial demographic profile \""representivity\"" system in the Western Cape, where the white and brown populations are 70% of the population. Yet, the national government appoints 90% black people there and also expects private businesses to do the same. Solidarity has successfully challenged this practice in the Labour Court in the Department of Correctional Services matter, but the national government is ignoring the Court ruling up to this day, proving their true nature as a black supremacist movement. Totalitarianism 101. \""Representivity\"" is a classic communist scam like \""cadre deployment\"" ? even Obama tried to implement it in USA? ",sa-news,0

There are 36 kinds of bees, meaning that for any given catastrophe, at least one of them is likely to survive. If there is only one kind of human, our chances are very limited. There used to be about 9 kinds of human but we did our best to destroy them through mixing it up? we should know better now. YOU might think you are being all noble and moral by \""not being a racist\"", but in fact you are disobeying a fundamental law of nature, and also neutralizing your own natural and evolutionary self defense mechanism? and helping to destroy your own culture, heritage and genetic uniqueness ? just so that globalists can make more stinking profits.

"Black Township Protesting Power Cuts, Blocks Eskom From Inspecting Sub Station, After Racist \""Gangster\"" Mayor Implements Extra Load Shedding on Top of Eskoms!","Gangsterism and cutting off your nose to spite your face, seems to be a recurring theme in #TheAfricanWay: Amsterdam in Mpumalanga has instituted its own internal electricity revolving power cuts, of 5 hours per day, and the Mayor refuses to speak English at community feedback meetings. The Mkhondo (Piet Retief) municipality serving Amsterdam in Mpumalanga has now also instituted \""internal\"" load shedding on top of Eskom?s own load shedding. The community is in uproar over an additional 5 hours per day load shedding, on top of the scheduled Eskom load shedding. Giel Coetzer, a businessman in town says his business is at a standstill and everyone?s food and meat is rotting in their fridges. The local mayor, Vusi Motha, was supposed to address a multiracial meeting of both black and white residents last week, but he and other officials arrived an hour and a half late. He then acted in a very racist way by insisting to speak only in Zulu although he knew that not everyone can understand it. Another recurring theme for these troubled municipalities, is the pedigree of these gangster mayors that rose through the ranks from the militant ANC Youth League. Executive Mayor Vusi Motha was also on the Regional Executive Committee of the African National Congress of the Gert Sibande region and he is currently the Regional Deputy Chairperson of the ANC. In 2018, local residents accused mayor Vusi Motha of being a gangster in and called for his removal after three people were killed in the area during protests against him. Other locals reported receiving death threats from Vusi Motha, whilst others said there was a hit list of people to be killed from Vusi Motha. The Mkhondo Local Municipality in Piet Retief, on the border with KwaZulu-Natal has had its share of corruption, maladministration and mismanagement of funds, and has been investigated by the Zondo commission, but these Mpumalanga municipalities, which have a track record of mismanagement and maladministration are notorious for being cash cows for corrupt politicians, have been dragging their feet to submit financial documents requested by the commission. Mayor Musi Motha gave no explanations or answers at the community meeting. Maqhawe Kunene, municipal manager told Maroela Media that the municipality can only distribute 1, 5 MVA electricity capacity at the moment although the demand is 2, 3 MVA. Kunene says that Eskom has imposed the reduced supply of 1, 5 MVA due to insufficient infrastructure in the municipality that can?t handle the load. Kunene says the sub station that belongs to Eskom does not have sufficient capacity to carry the demands of a growing population. Eskom has been trying to inspect the sub station for the last few days but rioting township residents blocked them. Police will now escort Eskom engineers to the sub station. In the meanwhile residents will keep on paying the price for #TheAfricanWay of failing to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, choosing instead to plunder the funds that were meant for those projects. Projects, which in themselves were corrupt, that had to be cancelled included: A 3km road that would have been built for an astronomically over priced R81.4 million The installation of 940 smart meters without a council resolution. The project cost R81 million and electricity money was allegedly siphoned to private individuals; R100 million spent on water tanks, but still no water is provided to rural communities; and Payment of R21 million for the paving of a street that is less than 1km long.

"Trial of 7 Black Farm Murderers From 2017 Postponed Yet Again, As Suspects & Legal Aid Board Play The Corrupt System Like A Fiddle!","In South Africa slow justice leads to no justice: The farm murder trial of 7 accused did not start since 2017, due to delaying tactics by the accused, assisted by the Legal Aid Board, seven black farm murderers in a farm murder case and an attempted farm murder case, in the Kleinfontein area of North West, are playing the system and dragging the case out endlessly with the help of the Legal Aid Board. The accused are in custody for attempted murder by shooting and wounding farmer Hennie Eksteen on 29 June 2017 on his farm, and murdering farmer Dries Botha, who was overpowered outside his house when he went to activate an alarm system at his sheep kraal and shed on Tuesday 4th July 2017 at about 20:00. He succumbed to his wounds in hospital a few days later. It is suspected that five shots were fired at Dries Botha and he sustained three shot wounds in the upper body and a shot wound in the arm, while his wife was inside the house. She locked herself in the bathroom and called their neighbours for help after she heard her husband screaming outside. Botha fought back prompting his attackers to flee the scene, without stealing anything. Both incidents happened in the same area. The cases were previously postponed several times after the Legal Aid Board had to appoint new lawyers, for the account of taxpayers of course, after the accused began to point fingers at each other. Two of the accused escaped out of the Hartbeestpoort police cells in December 2018, but they were later re-arrested. Eventually the magistrate postponed the cases to 4th, 17th and 20th February this year for trial, but on the 4th February only one attorney from the Legal Aid Board showed up. The case was then postponed to 17th February, but then Adv. Naas de Jager, representing 4 of the accused, announced that he was withdrawing, because one of the accused, Caiphus Shilenge, keeps changing his story the whole time. The magistrate in the matter postponed the case again pending the appearance of the head of the Legal Aid Board in North West, appearing in front of the Court to explain the situation. It is uncertain when the matter will now be tried as the Legal Aid Board head in the province must appear before Court before anything can be decided. ",sa-news,0
"#TheAfricanWay Sub-Station in Springs Burns Down Because Ekhurhuleni (East Rand) Municipality Failed To Do Repairs After Break-in Last Year, Despite Being Warned It Could Catch Fire, Leaving Thousands Without Power!","#BetterUnderApartheid An important electrical sub-station in Springs, which was damaged during a break-in by vandals last year, was left in the dilapidated state, creating a fire risk, has finally burnt down on Sunday, leaving thousands of residents and manufacturing businesses in the industrial area New Era, without electricity. It could take up to 2 weeks to repair the damage. The businesses in the industrial area like Kellogg?s, will obviously lose millions of Rands in lost manufacturing. The substation was never properly fixed after the last break-in and an electrician warned the Ekurhuleni Metro Municipality in a damage report, which was compiled after the last break-in, that the substation is a ticking time bomb, and was for instance, not properly earthed. The reason for the Metro?s lack of action to fix the damage seems to be that the insurer never wanted to pay out an insurance claim for the damage caused by the vandals. Dare we ask? The insurance claim could be as high as R100 Million, but the insurer rejected the claim due to insufficient security arrangements, like an electric fence that was in place during the break-in. The electrician?s damage report did state that the sub-station could burn down for various reasons, amongst others that it won?t automatically shut down during an electric overload. Anita Greeff of the local business association says that 2 CEO?s of manufacturing companies in the area informed them about the terrible state of the sub station about a month ago, and they in turn informed the manager of the electricity department, the City Manager and the Mayor, Cllr Zwandile Masina, who has been in office since 2016, who is also the Regional Chairperson of the ANC in Ekurhuleni, and served previously as convener of the ANC Youth League. However, predictably with such an ANC \""pedigree\"", nothing was done. Private business people and the general public are now left in the dark. #TheAfricanWay of not fixing and maintaining infrastructure is again on display. Unfortunately it seems that greed and looting is more important to these black African officials, than doing the jobs for which they get a huge salary. Whites are banned from the public workplace by the ANC, so they can only look on n horror as the ANC pillages and destroys everything they touch, yet at the same time blaming whites for everything, and using Apartheid as a shield to hide their own crimes behind.

"#KakFonteinANC Randfontein Renamed to Kakfontein Due to Stinking Rivers & Dams, Even The Air Stinks! ALL Towns & Cities Becoming Kakfontein in ANCs Sh*thole South Africa!","#BetterUnderApartheid Do you wonder why the ANC and blacks in general are so keen to jump on the \""beat the dead Apartheid donkey\"" bandwagon? Well, they do not want scrutiny, or accountability for the corruption and sh*thole they have turned South Africa into, especially when being compared to the first world standards it used to have in the Apartheid era,which saw Africans risking their lives crossing crocodile infested waters, to get INTO Apartheid RSA! For example, Randfontein?s people have now given their own ANC run town a different name, they say they stay in K*kfontein these days. It?s no joke either. Come smell the air here they say. Matiam van Vuuren says the smell of raw sewage that stuck to his braaivleis back in 2016, was the last straw for him. He went down to the Police station and opened a criminal case in terms of Article 151 (1) of the Water Act, against municipal officials, who have willfully or by neglect allowed widespread pollution of rivers and dams in the area. Van Vuuren says there is still rubbish, raw sewage and dead fish in the Rietspruit dam in Uniepark. He says the years long terrible stench around rivers and dams caused by raw sewage in the water has led to the people of the town renaming their town to a somewhat \""smellier\"" name. They certainly had reason to. Netwerk 24 visited the town recently to smell the air for themselves, and advised motorists to tightly shut their windows on the corner of Greenhills lane and Raven Way, because the stench of rotten water hangs thick in the air. On the surface of the pitchblack dam there is oil and an unknown white substance floating on the water. Near the dam is a ditch where raw sewage is oozing out. Raw sewage is also flowing into the Rietspruit. Van Vuuren says that farmers used the water sources in the past for crops and animals, but today the water is not fit for human or animal consumption! Randfontein kakfontein Van Vuuren says his neighbour?s calves were born dead because of the dirty water. It is now four years since Van Vuuren laid his criminal complaint and he finally managed to get the national department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries to co-operate, and with the help of the Green Scorpion unit of the department, the case is now at last ready for trial in the local regional court. Van Vuuren says there is a strong case and that there is evidence like water samples. According to him the case will proceed on 8 April and that Themba Goba, the municipal manager, is also charged in his private capacity in terms of the Water Act. ANALYSIS: It is highly commendable what this gentleman has done for his community as it is necessary to try and force accountability amongst the black majority, although at the end of the day, any punitive fines will still be paid for by the taxpayers. But there is certainly a larger picture here to take note of. That is to look simply at the way things get done in Africa in general, which can be summed up with Thabo Mbeki?s term #TheAfricanWay. We have seen how the ANC and it?s sidekick, the EFF, have made it illegal for any white person to serve in top management positions in South Africa. We have seen how the most important qualifying characteristic one must have to serve in a top position is being black. So with that in mind let us look at #TheAfricanWay in more details. Yes, there are laws like the Water Act in South Africa. But a main feature of #TheAfricanWay is selective prosecutions. They make the lofty laws, then don?t enforce it. During Apartheid we had some of the best laws in the world against money laundering and then Zuma and his tsotsis, employing #TheAfricanWay, captured everyone involved in law enforcement and prosecutions process, and suddenly the Guptas could carry hundreds of billions of stolen loot out of the country. #TheAfricanWay means laws they make don?t get enforced in the end. #TheAfricanWay is slow decay and rot and continued looting as if there is no tomorrow. #TheAfricanWay is black Africans clearly not caring for anything but chasing instant wealth. They certainly don?t care about the next generation. #TheAfricanWay is not taking responsibility but instead perpetuating victimhood and creating narratives and blaming the white man in the end, when everything inevitably comes to ruins and bankruptcy. The question that needs to be asked is how many other small and large towns have turned into K*kfonteins? Has South Africa itself not been turned into one big K*kfontein, if you look at the rot, crime and destruction all around us? ",sa-news,0
"#TheAfricanWay: Potchefstroom Municipality Being Run Like Organized Crime Syndicate, Complete With Slush Fund Operated by Local Lawyers!","Anyone know how an all expenses trip to the Durban July for Councillors helps local residents in Potchefstroom and Ventersdorp? Chris Hattingh of the DA says the combined municipality for Potchefstroom and Ventersdorp (called JB Marks) is run like an organized crime syndicate and available facts prove it. Of course stealing and plundering is just #TheAfricanWay and wherever things are run hy a black majority, there will be stealing and plundering. It?s their culture as both Zuma and Mbeki admitted. Even in Tshwane, which is being run further into the ground by the black dominated DA in Tshwane, there is stealing, looting and incompetence. It has emerged that the local ANC run Potchefstroom municipality operates a slush fund in the form of a trust, registered at a local lawyer in Potchefstroom. It of course also, once again, demonstrates the unscrupulousness of the local legal profession in sh*thole South Africa. The slush fund, registered at a local lawyer paid out an amount of R161,329 so that Councillors could go to the Durban July last year, for a little vacation, which included food and drink no doubt. The controversial Durban July trip was first reported by the local Potchefstroom Herald newspaper. The municipal manager, Lebo Ralekgetho, (pictured), whose job description states he should \""manage the financial administration of the Municipality\"", first defended the Durban July trip, but later backtracked and said it should be investigated. Not that it is being investigated now anyway. He also did not say why the municipality would need a slush fund registered at a local lawyer, or how much money flows through the slush fund, or what the money is used for. It should once again be pointed out that these black officials seem to be acting as if the money belongs to them. They don?t seem to know that it?s taxpayer funds meant to be used for the benefit of residents. The Hawks are investigating the Durban July trip and another transaction where R 1,7 million was transferred to an outside account. The municipality?s own accounts show that an amount of R 2,6 million is outstanding and being owed by serving Councillors, who came into it in unlawful ways. Yet no steps is being taken against the Councillors. The Auditor General?s report on the municipality for the 2018/19 year sketches a dark picture. The figures show an amount of R 2,1 Billion in irregular expenses, R833 Million in unlawful expenditure and 76 million in wasteful spending (no results achieved). The Auditor General also found that the municipality did not stick within acquisition procedures and did not keep proper track of expenses, and had mentioned in his last and previous reports, that the municipality never investigates it when money is wasted, stolen or irregularly spent. Officials also don?t get investigated, even if complaints against them are lodged for financial irregularities. The local \""mayor\"" Kgotso Khumalo is fighting a decision by the North West provincial government to place Potchefstroom under administration in court, something for which taxpayer funds is also used of course.

"ANC Hide Their Crimes Behind Apartheid, Which Was NOT a Crime Against Humanity, as the Communist Soviet Union Propaganda Tried To Claim at the UN!","After a humiliating experience during the SONA State of the Nation Address, where traitor F.W. De Klerk and his second wife Elita, were badly verbally abused by his own darling blacks, Nobel laureate De Klerk unexpectedly hit back this time, and believe it or not, defended Apartheid. Maybe public humiliation does work on such a person, who sold Kith, Kin and Country for Coin, and false virtue? Once again, SA?s corrupt black majority managed to shift the spotlight from themselves, and their crimes and looting of SA, and once again beat the poor dead Apartheid donkey, blaming it for everything! During the State of the Nation Address, EFF leader Julius Malema said, among other things, that the former President De Klerk?s hands were dripping ?with blood?. The EFF claimed ? even before Cyril Ramaphosa could begin his speech ? that De Klerk?s hands were \""dripping with blood,\"" including the blood of those killed in 1992 in Boipatong City. The EFF party also claimed that De Klerk had said a week earlier, in an interview, that apartheid was not a \""crime against humanity\"" and that he should therefore be removed from Parliament immediately. That request was later rejected by Speaker Thandi Modise. The former president and leader of the then National Party (NP), who turns 84 next month, had sat in the public gallery as he watched and heard the spectacle of the EFF downstairs. The next day, Friday, February 14, the De Klerk Foundation released a statement, regarding the manner in which the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), bullied the former president at the annual State of the Nation Address (SONA). It was only available in English. The De Klerk Foundation, founded in 1999 to promote the causes for which De Klerk worked during his presidency, said that what happened at SONA was \""wave after wave of vitriolic attacks\"" by Julius Malema and EFF MPs in their trademark red overalls. They then alluded to trademark symbolism of other supremacist groups who had a \""supreme leader\"" like Malema. According to the foundation, De Klerk, the last president of South Africa during apartheid (1989 to 1994), \""repeatedly acknowledged the serious injustices committed under apartheid, and on several occasions sincerely apologized to those who did suffer under previous governments.\"" The statement said the insults \""were more than empty words; he dedicated his entire presidency to the abolition of apartheid and the negotiation of a new Constitution that would entrench the rights of all South Africans, regardless of race. He oversaw the process that led to the repeal of all remaining apartheid laws, \""he added. Well, that might have sounded noble at the time, but as everyone knows, De Klerk?s infamous \""Checks & Balances\"" never happened, leaving whites at the mercy of a malevolent, often racist black majority on a daily basis. Even Malema?s comments were a bit rich, seeing that Malema himself said a few years ago that it was better under Apartheid: Malema apartheid But was Apartheid a crime against humanity? The foundation said that in November 1966 the UN General Assembly declared Apartheid as a crime against humanity ? and in 1973 adopted the Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. \""Both the resolution and the convention were political initiatives by the Soviet Union ? which itself had committed heinous crimes against humanity, which involved the deaths of millions,\"" the statement reads. In 1976, when the convention came into force, 23 of the 31 signatories were \""not free\"", according to Freedom House in New York. \""Six were partly free ? and only two were free. Ironically, Apartheid South Africa was classified as \""partially free\"" ? and had a better record of human rights than 27 of the signatories,\"" he added. None of the major core democracies are in the 109 states that later joined the Convention. According to the United Nations delegation: \""As good as it is, from a legitimate point of view, we cannot accept that Apartheid can become a crime against humanity in this way. Crimes against humanity are so serious in nature that they must be carefully worked out and strictly interpreted under existing international law? \"" \""The idea that apartheid was\"" a crime against humanity \""was and remains an\"" agitprop \""project initiated by the Soviets and their African National Congress (ANC) / South African Communist Party (SACP) allies to stigmatize white South Africans by uniting them with sincere crimes against humanity ? which generally includes totalitarian oppression and the slaughter of millions of people,\"" the foundation states. According to the statement, between 1960 and 1994 about 23,000 people died in South Africa?s political violence ? of which less than 5,000 were killed by security forces. Most of the rest of the deaths occurred in the tribal conflict between the Inkatha Freedom Party (Zulu) and the ANC (Xhosa) ? black on black violence. This compares to 500,000 killed during ANC rule. In Kenya, the British interned over 320,000 people during the Mau-Mau uprising and hanged more than a thousand Mau-Mau members. In Algeria, the French killed more than 140,000 people in a war that claimed approximately 700,000 lives. None of those were declared crimes against humanity? \""None of this is intended to abolish the injustices that have undoubtedly been committed under apartheid, as under any government. However, we need a balanced understanding of the past ? not one based on a ?simplistic black / white, good / bad framework?, but on a framework that reflects the infinite shades of gray that characterize history, ? he added. It is on this basis that De Klerk apparently made the controversial remark and furthermore, \""no evidence was found that De Klerk was implicated in any violence,\"" the foundation says. As more and more white South Africans, who voted Yes in 1992, learn that the entire abolition of Apartheid, was part of the New (or Liberal) World Order plot, FW De Klerk?s position is becoming more and more untenable, and we must start asking questions about the narrative that the mainstream media used to tell us at the time. It becomes more and more clear when one looks at how the same \""anti-racism\"" weapon is used to take over Europe, forcing it into one \""EU Superstate\"" ? another multicultural nightmare. The only way to force a dozen nations, as in the case of SA, into one State, is to break down, mix, and displace their identities, languages, cultures, traditions, standards, morals, religion and society as a whole. into one that \""everyone\"" accepts, namely materialism and consumerism ? where the multinational companies and organizations make all the profits and power. No matter your race, your culture is now iPads, Idols and Netflix. It is obvious that in 1994 SA was a guinea pig for what is now going on in Europe and the US: The \""Kalergi Plan\"". ",sa-news,0
"We Know You Did NOT Watch The SONA Circus, So We Watched & Saw a Mad Hatters Tea Party in La La Land, Where Nonsense Rules!","The SONA speech reflected the truth of the matter ? Ramaphosa, the EFF and Bantu have squandered their chance. After a quarter of a century, Bantu are still living in the past, constantly rewriting it, as they take the country even further backwards. Now let?s look at the reality and what the ANC and Mandela?s #TheAfricanWay has brought us? The first impression is of a circus, where red clad laughing clowns were joyfully playing and holding up the rest of the circus from getting underway. Secondly, there was a distinct feel of a Matric Dance or Prom to the whole affair, with some very infantile overdressed children with too much money to spend, roleplaying, trying to impress themselves each other. Only, most of them never even made Matric! There was certainly no feeling at all of a solemn reflection of a deeply bankrupt country in crisis. These people just don?t care about all the different crisis situations we face. That is why Ramaphosa was strong on the code speak and narrative creating again. He again, like every year, went to fetch the story 30 years ago with Nelson Mandela?s release. Is SONA going to be a revisionist history lecture every year? Are we not going to talk about the situation right now, never mind the real history? Truth is, objectively spoken, the release of Nelson Mandela heralded in: #TheAfricanWay, an afrocentic, black fascist reality and the incompetent scavenger like looting by the State of anything that is solvent. Mandela heralded in a country with no apparent values, where people just throw rubbish next to a public rubbish bin. Mandela heralded in the tyranny of the majority, where the majority?s votes keep the criminals in power and create new criminal parties like the EFF. Mandela heralded in the total onslaught on the minorities of the country and their value system and history. Mandela?s release heralded in the total collapse of each and every State institution like Eskom that once could be compared to the best in the world. Yes, it was Mandela that heralded all this in because the writers of the Constitution thought he was a god and wrote the Constitution in such a way as to give one man all power. Power which landed up with someone like Zuma and his tsotsis. Tsotsis who are still there by the way. Don?t we talk about this? Today after the circus themed Matric Ball, reality will settle back in: The reality of bankrupt and imploding State departments, institutions and municipalities. There reality of the report last week that only 18 municipalities in the country are not totally dysfunctional. Today the reality starts again of people being robbed, raped and killed by criminals. The reality of water and power cuts. The reality of failing sewage systems which causes a massive stink where people have to live and sewage to stream into rivers. The reality of crappy services at hospitals and some very unfriendly and uncaring black nurses sitting around when patients need care. Ramaphosa and liberal enablers in the media, must drop the false narrative and talk about how South Africa has been turned into a filthy trash heap with no apparent value systems. Talk about how the ANC brought in state capture as a policy tool and how the country is being looted bare in front of our eyes. Talk about how we are already a captured and thus a failed State. Oh wait?maybe it is us and our expectations that are in la la land? ",sa-news,0
"Forget The SONA Circus Where Scavengers Try Legitimize Their Greed, Heres SOFA: State Of Our Farmers Address According to TAU!","The annual State of the Nation speech did not only turn into a circus as usual, but again, even more communism and even more Afrocentrism was the order of the day. South Africa now belongs to the vultures, and they will cackle on about it till the rooster crows! All you can be sure of, is that there will be broad indications of their new plans to plunder even more, and even more folly with regards to State Entities, and the rewriting of our history. However, if you need a little reassurance, calm your nerves by reading TAU?s State of Our Farmers Address, from an agricultural perspective. Were it not for our farmers, all the clowns in Parliament might not have been so well (over?) fed, and the country would fast degenerate into an international humanitarian crisis, although it is already on its way there. Whilst it may not be such a good idea to produce too much food, just so the vultures can eat and breed even more, the Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU) SA, during this time of the 2020 State of the Nation speech foolhardiness, made some serious reflection on which plans ? from an agricultural perspective ? would be in the best interest of a disciplined South Africa?s residents, during 2020. TAU SA put together their 20-point plan that a responsible government could implement, to make the country prosperous again, if the were so inclined. But we all know by now, in Africa, nature reigns, and the rabbits will eat the grass, and breed, until there is no more grass, and then their numbers will drop again, until the grass grows back, and then they will start eating and breeding again, etc. etc. Here is TAU SA?s 20-point Plan for South Africa 2020: Recruit and establish new commercial entrants to agriculture, under the age of 45; Create new agricultural job opportunities; Establish syndicate and other farming models where expertise and capacity are pooled and / or utilized for greater profitability; Restore law and order so that farmers can apply their maximum attention and expertise to farming; Implement a complete free-market system of which ownership is the core; Implement a properly supportive disaster management plan for the benefit of all farmers in South Africa; Give farmers unrestricted access to international markets in order to earn essential currency for the country; Recognize agriculture without reservation as an essential part of the economy, by not making agriculture a game for party political gain or internationally obsolete ideologies; Improve infrastructure so that farmers can get their products to markets effectively, whether by road or rail; Stop the forced, undefined and never-ending transformation, including ending the discriminatory system of enforced black economic empowerment and so-called affirmative action; Restore investor confidence locally and internationally so that farmers will have no problem obtaining financing from any recognized financial institution; Improve government institutions so that farmers and agriculture can count on the support of functional local authorities and government departments, characterized by competent and corruption-free officials, regardless of race or gender; Create an effective value chain in which all stakeholders share in the risk of agriculture, as they also share in the increased profits; Protect and manage water resources in such a way that sufficient usable water will be available to agriculture for food security, with increased storage capacity and no pollution; Change the regulation of labor to enable maximum employment at a mutually agreed wage, in which quality training will be highly affordable and where workers will produce their maximum output; Restoring the economy and service delivery in the rural environment so that schools, businesses and churches can once again provide service to the entire rural community; Implement effective border control, which controls and manages Vito sanitation (diseases) as well as illegal immigrants, in order to improve safety and reduce pressure on domestic resources such as food, water and housing; Create a reliable and affordable power supplier, whether state supported or private; Invest in mother tongue education at school and tertiary level; and Control urbanization so that farmers in its immediate vicinity are not harmed.

Another Mining House Pulls out of South Africa. AngloGold Raises its Anchors & Sells all its SA Interests to Harmony,"With the continuing decline of the business environment in SA, AngloGold has also decided to join the exodus and has pulled out of South Africa, further weakening economic conditions, although it has divested its interests. In doing so, the mining group ends its long history of mining in South Africa and, with the sale of all its interests at R4,4 Billion, finally showed its heels to SA. The new owners, Harmony, snapped up the last two active operations of AngloGold with the aim of reducing its own risk. However, the fact that Harmony bought the industry does not mean that everything remains unchanged, because every mining house or industry leaving the country causes new investors to come in and take over the interests. AngloGold?s Chief Executive, Canadian Kelvin Dushnisky, has not let the grass grow under his feet and has moved from one group to the next, and with the latest move, sold the last part of the interests in SA. As we reported last week, Power cuts have caused sever disruption to operations and Mining houses have already begun urgent planning to make power generation more stable by using solar panel energy generation.

Journalist Assaulted by Bloemfontein Lawyer Roelie Rossouw While Interviewing Ex Freestate Premier Ace Magashules Friend About Overpriced Tenderpreneur Deals With Bankrupt Bloemfontein Municipality!,"Wheeling, Dealing & Stealing? A controversial Free State tenderpreneur?s lawyer assaulted a journalist after she asked questions about inflated vehicle tenders to Bloemfontein municipality, including a Nyala Riot Vehicle which the Municipality has no use of, and has no Metro Police to even make use it, with a massive mark-up. Mothebe Wheels has already sold more than a 100 vehicles to the Metro, each with its own mark up on the original manufacturer?s price. David Mothebe had told Netwerk 24 journalist, Marietjie Gericke he will talk with her in the office of his lawyer, Roelie Rossouw, but once the interview started, Rossouw said his client doesn?t have to tell the journalist anything. Gericke asked if she can take a photo of Rossouw and Mothebe, and after they did not answer, she took a photo of Rossouw. He then ran around the desk, violently grabbed Gericke by the arm, grabbed her phone and ran away with the phone and went to hide behind a closed door. This is very strange given he has a photo of himself on his website. The red marks from Rossouw?s fingers were visible on Gericke?s arm and a colleague took photos of the marks afterwards. David Mothebe approached Gericke outside the building afterwards and wanted to know who her sources are. She asked if she could take a photo of him, but he hid behind a tree. He then left in a brand new Porsche without number plates? Mothebe porsche What makes this behavior even stranger, is that Roelie Rossouw is a lawyer with a long history in Bloemfontein. He started the company way back in 1988, as a branch from a Welkom firm. Nowadays they claim on their website to have an \""aggressive Affirmative Action policy\"", even though all their top staff are not BEE. So how does an apartheid era firm like this get to represent pro black tenderpreneurs with questionable dealings, and how does a lawyer, who DOES know better, resort to violence? Yes, we know many lawyers will do anything or say anything for a \""fee\"" of course. Seems it doesn?t matter if it is corrupted money, blood money or stolen money. It is not coincidence there are so many jokes about lawyers, like a \""tikkiebox\"", just throw in money and a man like Roelie Rossouw will talk and talk arrogantly. Reverting to violence reveals the pressure he must be under in the background with these high stakes deals? An image on their website gives away the ironic Socialist stance behind the firm?s ethos: free law So this lifelong lawyer has just assaulted a journalist, a woman at that, in his office after the journalist, Marietjie Gericke of Netwerk24 wanted to ask questions to a local tenderpreneur, David Mothebe of Mothebe Wheels, a third party middelman supplier of vehicles and trucks to the Bloemfontein Metro. Mothebe is reportedly a big friend of Ace Magashule, the former Free State Premier who is well known for state capture and cadre deployment policies, that left the Free State in ruins. Ace Magashule: We?ll confiscate the assets of white South Africans ? He sketched a kind of Marxist-Leninist future for the country in which private property, banks and industries will be nationalised and \""Africanised\"" APRIL 11, 2019. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, is seen in Kliptown, Johannesburg. He walked through the streets speaking to members of the community. PHOTOGRAPH: ALON SKUY Magashule needs no introduction of course, not to any resident of the Free State with its bankrupt municipalities where lack of basic services like water and the stench of raw sewage, that run down the road into streams is commonplace. SA-News reported yesterday that Mothebe as middleman supplier to the Bloemfontein Metro, supplied a Nyala armored truck to the Metro, which has no Metro Police, as well as 10 busses to the Metro. Every vehicle that Mothebe sells to the Metro comes with a huge mark up on the price of the original supplier. For instance Mothebe Wheels asked the Metro R5,8 million for the Nyala, but the supplier in Johannesburg can sell it to anyone direct for R 2 million less. The Nyala has not yet been handed over because Bloemfontein Municipality has no one who can be trained to drive it. ",sa-news,0
"BUSTED! Massive R568 Million PIC Plundered From Government Workers Pension For Bare Land, Was To Save Bankrupt Pension Fund For Politicians!","ROBBING PETER (GEPF) TO SAVE PAUL (POLITICIANS) WHO WAS ROBBED TOO. Solidarity trade union has uncovered the reason why PIC approved an obviously fraudulent transaction. They called it right, watch this space. The massive R586 million overpaid by the State monopoly managing the pension fund for government workers (GEPF), the Public Investment Commissioner (PIC), has incriminated themselves and broken all ethics and codes of conduct, such a body should adhere to, when they tried to bailout the bankrupt municipal councillor?s pension fund, the majority of whose members are ANC councilors, it now seems. The Pension Fund for municipal councillors (MCPF), whose members are politicians only, was so mismanaged and bankrupt that it was placed under curatorship a while back. The curators discovered that a property developer of Klerksdorp called Isago@N12Development owed the MCPF over R130 million. Isago agreed in a court case to pay the MCPF that money back . Only problem was that Isago did not have the money, which left the municipal councillors and teh MCPF out of pocket. Well, until their buddies at the PIC made a plan to massively overpay Isago for the purchase of the bare farm Palmietfontein at Klerksdorp, about 1,000 hectares, some of it dolomite ground at R570,173 per hectare, over 28 times higher than the market rate per hectare. After weeks of investigation, Solidarity issued a statement today: State capture has mutated into the planned capturing of the last ?pot of gold? still ?filled with gold? in South Africa: the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF). SA-News reported on this last week here and other news columns were filled with the news of the farm Palmietfontein being bought in 2018, by the Public Investment Commissioner (PIC), on behalf of the Government Employees Pension Fund, for the amount of R586 million. This price is reportedly up to 2,000% above the market value of the neighbouring farms. It was reported that part of the deal was that the sellers, Isago will then pay over their R130 million debt to the Municipal Councillors Pension Fund (MCPF) ? presently under curatorship. Solidarity circulated a report that they have lodged a PAIA application (freedom of information) to the PIC, requesting the disclosure of records relating to this deal. An early analysis of this deal however is the following: Municipal Councillors Pension Fund (MCPF) is under curatorship and under the threat of liquidation. This deal with this massively inflated price, part of which will be paid over to the (MCPF) can have one true purpose only: to safe the Municipal Councillors Pension Fund from liquidation using your (and my) pension money. If above is true, the pension fund of state employees is used to rescue the pension fund of all the municipal councillors ? the state employees? pension money is used to rescue the pension fund of the political representatives at municipal level: classical pension capture! The pensions of ordinary state workers: police officials, nurses, secretaries and more is used to fund the pensions of representatives of political parties. Similarly SA-News reported on the proposal from the trade union federation Cosatu (of which Popcru is a member) that Government Employee Pension Fund (GEPF)-money to the amount of R254 BILLION should be plundered to bail out bankrupt Eskom, to save the banksters, who spearheaded the proposal, from default. This is presently being discussed and negotiated in various forums including Nedlac and according to reports, a draft agreement is presently considered. This is too similar to the Klerksdorp scam to be coincidental and also highly irregular. Was it a trial run? The pension fund contributions of state employees are entrusted to the GEPF, which has the fiduciary duty to invest and manage funds in the best interest of the pension fund ? not the best interest of Eskom or the best interest of Cosatu or Popcru or even MCPF. The GEPF appointed the Public Investment Commissioner to invest their (our) money and gave them a specific mandate and set of principles to apply when doing so. Any investment by the PIC has to be considered by the PIC against the mandate given to them by the GEPF. This is an internal PIC process. Any PIC investment above R2 Billion has to be approved by the GEPF. It is highly irregular ? even unlawful ? that any future investment of GEPF funds by the PIC be decided upon by ANY external forum, and even more irregular and more unlawful for the PIC and the GEPF to willy-nilly accept such external decision. It will amount to classical pension capture by the state! Solidarity hosted a press conference today at which the first legal steps were announced to stop the capture of public service pensions. The nature of these legal steps will only be determined when the final (Nedlac) agreement on the funding of Eskom becomes known and/or when the PIC/GEPF accepts said agreement and approve the funding of Eskom, without implementing their own internal processes or acting irrationally or unlawfully when doing so.

When Wolves Guard The Sheep: Public Protectors Birthday Party More Like A Whos Who of Shady Criminals,"The controversial Busisiwe Mkhwebane, who seems to be the Public Protector in name only, recently celebrated her 50th birthday, but invited guests were people who should be considered \""questionable\"" friends given her position. She ended up in the crossfire over her birthday party?s guest list, and experts believe it is rather people who should be investigated by the Public Protector for their possible share in various corruption incidents. Some of the \""strange friends\"" are people accused of being involved in corruption and bribery, some of whom were dismissed by the ANC president from their posts as members of the 2018 cabinet such as Bongani Bongo, who was accused of bribery and corruption, and later fired, was one of her birthday friends. Mosebenzi Zwane also attended the festivities, and is being investigated for possible involvement in the Guptas scandal, and is also a former minister who was fired.

"Bankrupt Bloemfontein Buys Nyala Armoured Riot Vehicle, But Has No Metro Police Force To Use It! Just Another ANC Scam To Rob Taxpayers of R6 Million?","THE GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW NATION: If corrupt ANC cadres could sell sand to an Arab for a Billion, they would! The middleman supplier in Bloemfontein made almost R2 Million profit, supplying just one vehicle, that was not needed and cannot be used, like sand to an Arab! The bankrupt and under administration Bloemfontein municipality has a brand new Nyala armored riot vehicle, but it doesn?t have a Metro Police force to use it! The man who was appointed as the Metro Police chief, Israel Kgamanyane, says he is now sitting for 2 years in his post as Chief, but he has nobody under him. He is however unhappy that he was not consulted on the buying of the Nyala vehicle, at a reported price of almost R 6 million. The Nyala was bought through the municipality?s third party middleman supplier, Mothebe Wheels. Conveniently Mothebe supply all vehicles that the Metro buys. Even though there are no staff in the Metro Police, the Metro also bought 10 busses, together with the Nyala at R 5, 5 million per bus, it was found in an investigation by the DA. Kgamanyane says he can supply the name of the Nyala manufacturer in Johannesburg and that the manufacturer asks R 3, 9 million for the Nyala. If this figure is correct, Mothebe Wheels would have made a profit of almost R 2 million on the supply of one vehicle! Hein van Vuuren, manager of Mothebe Wheels, says Mothebe did win a tender to supply vehicles to the Metro, and supplied about 100 vehicles to the municipality in the last 2 years. Despite all these riches from corruption, Mothebe wheels does not have a website, only a facebook page, see below. However, Van Vuuren says the Nyala can?t be handed over to Mangaung Metro, before they train somebody to drive the vehicle, and remember there is not even a single Metro Police member besides the Chief!

"ANC Regime Are African Tinpot Despots: Pension Fund Plunder Makes R556 MILLION \""Profit\"" on Unused Bare Land in Klerksdorp! The Facts:","LAND DEAL OF THE CENTURY: We just can?t stop the ANC regime which has captured South African government institutions, to use as personal cash machines, running the country like African tinpot despots. The capture and crookedness, the famous #AfricanWay, is just too deep seated. Ramaphosa is sitting on the findings of the Mpati commission for several months now while the PIC, which runs the Government Employee?s Pension Fund GEPF), paid 28 times the going rate for a piece of of bare land which was bought by a fraudulent Klerksdorp developer, Isago@N12 Development, for only R20 million. We have been subjected to State Capture news for years, and there has been a judicial commission of enquiry into the workings of the Public Investment Commissioner (PIC) , called the Mpati commission, but still something like this happens? To top off the Land Deal of the Century, which we covered here, the GEPF is now the proud owners of ONLY 60 % of this piece of land in question, 1,028 hectares in total. The directors of Isago are, Ramata Knunou, a family doctor of Klerksdorp, and a Doreen Crause who remains the owners of 39% and 1% percent now sommer belongs to alleged \""soldiers\"" of the ANC armed wing and APLA (The #BlackFigLeaf no doubt). To add more insult to injury, 60 hectares of the purchased land is dolomite and prone to sink holes. This deal is as crooked as can come but the crooked PIC still maintains in the media that they did all the necessary due diligence studies, before signing off on the deal in November 2019? Some facts are: ? Isago was paid R570,173 per hectare by the PIC on behalf of the GEPF for these 2 pieces of land. ? The PIC says they paid that much because the plan is to do developments on the land. Yet Isago also owned another piece of land close by which they sold at a much lower R 5084 per hectare in 2011. That land was developed afterwards. A mall was built on it by Redefine Properties. Redefine certainly saw no need to pay such a ridiculous price for that property. ? The now GEPF land is still zoned as Agricultural land. ? A company that does valuations which they get from comparative sales in the area valued the GEPF land at R 2863 per hectare. ? Some of the GEPF land was already expropriated without compensation by the Klerksdorp municipality. Roads and infrastructure for the Redefine mall was built on it. ? The Klerksdorp municipality has legal claims of R 29, 5 million against Isago pending in court. ? Klerksdorp municipality (Matlosana) claims R 10 million from Isago for electricity, which wasn?t paid and where the ratepayers of Klerksdorp had to cough up in the end. ? Matlosana has an agreement in place where Isago must give them 10 % of all its profits. This agreement kicks in if any Isago property is sold to third parties and where they don?t develop it themselves. ? This whole saga with the GEPF is a copy and paste of Isago transactions stemming from 2017 where Isago sold vacant land to another pension fund (MCPF). Fraud with that transaction was discovered by the bankrupt MCPF curators and a case was opened with the Hawks. A court settlement was eventually reached where Isago agreed to pay back around R 120 million. But the big catch was that the MCPF would have to wait for the transaction with the GEPF to go through according to the agreement. ? Agricultural body SAAI has opened a criminal case with the Hawks in the past week with regards to this snout feeding exercise. ",sa-news,0

Abel Pienaar (42) was also shot in his stomach in the early morning hours of Saturday in his home in Safari-Tuine, Rustenburg. We covered the George Spalding incident here and it is possible that the same gang is involved. Both men are now being treated in the ICU of a local hospital. Pienaar lives with his wife Lizelle and 3 children in a gated complex and Pienaar went out at around 01:30 to bring in the family?s budgie, which he had forgotten outside. Just as Pienaar went out and returned with the budgie, an intruder came in behind him. The intruder who came in, a black male, was one of 3 home invaders who just broke in at a neighbouring flat and stole electronic equipment. They had fled when a boy woke up during the incident and shouted. Pienaar was thinking of the safety of his wife and children and wanted to get the intruder away, so he approached him. The intruder then shot Pienaar in the stomach, after missing him with his first shot. Pienaar?s wife and children were sleeping on the second level of the duplex flat when the incident happened, but woke up from the shots. Pienaar underwent an emergency operation on Saturday and will have another operation on Monday. His intestines were damaged and his pelvis bone fractured.

#1millionGraves S.A government is preparing more than 1 million graves in Gauteng,"#1millionGraves The South African Government is currently digging more that 1 million graves in Honingnestkrans Cemetery, north of Pretoria. This come after the rise in Covid19 cases in the country. While an excavator dug up the graves, MEC for Health Dr Bandile Masuku and members of the provincial Forensic Pathology Services arrived for an inspection, accompanied by Tshwane chief operations officer James Murphy. The purpose of the visit was to ensure that the city would not be caught off-guard in the event of scores of Covid-19 deaths. The grave sites will add to 12 000 graves available in Ga-Rankuwa and 92 000 in Soshanguve and Klip-Kruisfontein. There are 60 000 at Zandfontein and 4 000 in Lotus Garden, while Olievenhoutbosch has 10 000 and Laudium has 2 000. Gauteng has more than 1.5 million graves for Covid-19-related deaths. Murphy said burial sites in the city were already being over-utilised due to numerous other deaths that were not Covid-19-related, making it necessary for the city to start preparing itself for all eventualities. Masuku, who has been travelling across the province to monitor preparedness in all municipalities, said it was unfortunate that while in this process he had already been told of more Covid-19 deaths. Of the visit, he said: \""This is to check how we will be able to cater in the event of having a whole lot of people passing on in a short space of time. \""All our municipalities have been putting up capacity and acquiring more in terms of the land that they?ll need for burial. \""It is an uncomfortable subject and one of the things that I would like to say is that we still have a good opportunity to manage how the peak treats us and how they would be able to pass through Gauteng.\"" He was happy that the City of Tshwane was well-prepared for any eventuality. Gauteng has at least 10 cases of Covid-19 per 100 000 people. He said fortunately, Tshwane still has fewer active cases, but preparation was necessary. He said statistics showed that people between the ages of 50 and 80 were the most vulnerable. To make matters worse, there has been a 30% increase in the number of deaths in Gauteng that were not Covid-19-related, which made the pandemic an added burden in the burial sector.",search67,0

Primary and Secondary School learners to return to class in 2021 in Kenya,"Learners in Kenya will return to school in 2021. This is after the Kenyean government declared this school calendar year as a year lost. Learners will return to their classes in 2021 to presume with their lessons. The school year in the East African country runs from January to November, when it climaxes with end-of-term exams. But Education Minister George Magoha said in a statement that the curve of Covid-19 infections was expected to flatten only by December.

The 9pm to 4am curfew will remain in place. However cases are surging, with over 8,000 reported infections and 164 deaths. \""Faced with this uncertain environment, the stakeholders have resolved to reopen all basic education learning institutions in January 2021,\"" said Magoha. \""This is based on the assumption that the infection curve will have flattened by December, 2020.\"" The decisions \""will apply to all children,\"" the statement said, specifying that this included schools offering international curriculum. Initially Kenya had planned to reopen schools in September for those in their final years of primary and secondary school to allow them to take their exams, however the mounting infection rate resulted in the shelving of this plan, the statement said. The re-opening of universities will take place on a \""case-by-case\"" basis, and the institutions were encouraged to consider phased re-opening and continue holding virtual classes and graduation ceremonies.",search67,0

Tignon Law: A must read for Black women in Brazilian weaves and wigs,"Tignon Law was passed in 1786. This law forced Black women (Slaves or Free) to cover their hair with a Tigon Cloth. This Law prevented Black women to display their hair in public because their hairstyles were more beautiful than those of White women and appeared more attractive to White males. Black women are often praised and revered for their hair. The texture of black hair is suitable for forming unique styles from the afro to braids. Even mainstream media often imitate styles invented and catered to women with Afrocentric hair without a mention of appreciation. Nevertheless, there was a time when black women weren?t allowed to display their hair in public. Keep reading to learn about the Tignon Laws and how it was used to fuel racial tensions in the United States. A tignon (tiyon) is a headdress used to conceal hair. It was adorned by free and slave Creole women of African ancestry in Louisiana in 1786. The sumptuary law was enacted under Governor Esteban Rodriguez Miró. The regulation was meant as a means to regulate the style of dress and appearance for people of color. Black women?s features often attracted male white, French, and Spanish suitors and their beauty was a perceived threat to white women. The tignon law was a tactic used to combat the men pursuing and engaging in affairs with Creole women. Simply put, black women competed too openly with white women by dressing elegantly and possessing note-worth beauty. Nonetheless, black women did not despair. Instead, they abided by the rule and turned it into fashion. The women used unique colors, jewels, ribbons, and wrapping styles which accentuated their gorgeousness even more. Out of this bore the various head ties seen today on women of color using unique materials, patterns, and flair. Tignons have been worn by women in the Caribbean islands of Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Dominica which included hidden messages. They used Madras ? a popular fabric amongst slaves and free women to achieve their head ties. Tignon law eventually went out of effect in the 1800?s yet, black women worldwide continue to use head wraps as wardrobe staples paying homage to their culture, signifying their pride, and looking stunning while doing so.",search67,0
WARNING: WhatsApp gifting or Stockvel is a pyramid scheme scam,"Joining Whatsapp gifting or stockvel will end in tears because it is a new pyramid scheme scam. Whatsapp gifting look and sound real because you are recruited by people you know or people you are in the same group with. But at the end it will collapse and many people will not get their payment including people you recruited. What is a WhatsApp Gifting or stokvel? Yet another ?quick buck? digital scheme has hit South Africa. This time, it?s WhatsApp gifting or stokvels. How do these work? People are recruited to join a WhatsApp gifting or stokvel group (using a WhatsApp chat group) by paying a joining fee. So, in order to be added to the group, you have to pay up. The average joining fee is R200, with the promise of around R1 000 return if you recruit two people into the group. When WhatsApp stokvels go wrong? \""My aunt recruited me for a WhatsApp gifting or Stokvel,\"" says Mbali, a student at the University of Johannesburg. \""I didn?t trust it at first until I was contacted by the group admin. She sent me voice notes talking me through the process. \""I paid the joining fee of R200 and had to recruit two people ? which I did ? in order to receive the R1 000. But I never received my money. I kept silent about not receiving my R1 000 payment because screenshots of proof of payments were being shared in the WhatsApp group. I hoped I would still receive mine. \""Weeks went by and I still hadn?t received my payment. At that time, my aunt hadn?t received any more payments that were promised to her either. I decided to message people from the group privately, and that?s when people started to leave the group. My aunt was left as group admin, and the only people left in the group were the people my aunt and I had recruited. Embarrassed and ashamed of what we had recruited people into, my aunt tried contacting the initial group admin, only to find that now the number didn?t exist. We also discovered that the payments we made to join were done using untraceable methods so that they didn?t link to the receiver.\"" WhatsApp gifting or stokvels: a new look for age-old pyramid schemes WhatsApp gifting or stokvels aren?t like traditional stokvels ? in fact, they work like a pyramid scheme, where participants earn money by finding new participants. Another name for a pyramid scheme is a Ponzi scheme. Pyramid or Ponzi schemes work by recruiting investors, who in turn get promised payment or returns if they recruit more people. The reality is that the person at the top of the scheme collects all the money, and those being recruited further down rarely see all, if any, of what was promised to them. The first few people to join or invest reap the rewards and the rest, typically, lose money. In South Africa, these types of schemes are illegal and you should avoid them, as your money is not secure with them.",search67,0

If you say R20 000 per taxi that comes up to R10 billion, the government will not have R10 billion in its kitty to provide to the taxi industry,\"" Mbalula said. He said it was not possible to award the industry more than the allocated amount as the government had no funds. Various industries had been impacted by the closure of businesses, Mbalula said. \""Our response to the virus has been informed by goodwill and sacrifices. Industries have fallen apart. Such industries should be saved if we can save them,\"" he said. Taxi owners will have to be genuine registered operators to benefit from the funding. The taxi industry had reportedly demanded more than the R1 billion being offered by the government.

The judge said the rapper?s argument made during the trial, that he was forced to confess to the murder, did not hold water, as he also confirmed during his evidence that he indeed pushed her against the wall of the room they were in. He said the rapper was angry with the deceased, and he committed his actions out of anger. However, he said Ngcobo ought to have known that his actions might lead to her death. \""The accused is therefore found guilty of culpable homicide and not murder. He is found not guilty on count 2,\"" said the judge. Pitch Black Afro was facing two charges, one for murder and defeating the ends of justice.",search67,0

List of people arrested by Hawks for VBS Mutual Bank scandal,"Hawks arrested 8 people for different charges relating to VBS Mutual Bank money scandal which led to the closing of the bank. Those who were arrested are: Tshifhiwa Matodzi, chairman of VBS and Vele Investments (a company which obtained the majority shareholding in VBS through an alleged scam); VBS treasurer Phophi Mukhodobwane; VBS CFO Philip Truter; non-executive directors of VBS and nominees of the PIC Ernest Nesane and Paul Magula; KPMG auditor Sipho Malaba; CEO and executive director of VBS Andile Ramavhunga; and VBS non-executive director and chair of the bank?s audit committee lt.genl. Avhsahoni Ramikosi, who was also the SAPS CFO. On Wednesday morning, the Hawks conducted simultaneous search-and-seizure operation on ten premises in Gauteng and Limpopo, Hawks Head Godfrey Lebeya announced at a press conference in which he and National Director of Public Prosecutions (NPA) Shamila Batohi discussed some of the details relating to the first wave of arrests in the case of 2.7-billion theft that crashed VBS Mutual Bank. Four men were arrested on Wednesday morning, three are expected to turn themselves in and another is in quarantine due to Covid-19. There was no resistance from the accused. They will appear in in the regional court in Palm Ridge in the east of Johannesburg on Thursday to answer to 47 counts. These include 5 counts of racketeering, 12 of theft, 7 of fraud, 15 of corruption and 7 money laundering counts. Lebeya declined to talk specifics, including to decline naming any suspects still under investigation. Lebeya did however repeatedly stated that \""all routes the VBS money followed, will be followed by the investigation\"". Batohi said that \""wherever the evidence takes us, the law will prevail\"". Lebeya did however avoided a direct answer when Scorpio asked whether he was in contact with the EFF?s deputy leader Floyd Shivambu, saying on \""a daily basis I receive calls from different people enquiring about aspects of investigations\"". Lebeya claimed that \""any communications with the head of an investigation will never misdirect that investigation\"". In South Africa, however, we know that not to be true. Shivambu last year alleged that he was in communication with Lebeya and that he was not being investigated. Stammering over this answer was unfortunate because Shivambu utilised it at the time to suggest an established and congenial relationship with the head of a unit which is supposed to investigate him while using Lebeya?s name in a political power game. By not addressing the matter, Lebeya is allowing himself and his name be used. Batohi described the investigation as a \""prosecutor guided model\"", a very effective technique the erstwhile Scorpions used with much success. She praised the investigations team for excellent work already done. \""It is imperative that we move with speed to finalise\"" the case, Batohi explained, saying that the has worked meticulously since August 2018, going through the evidence with a \""fine-tooth comb\"". \""We owe it to all the investors of the bank, particularly the elderly women and men who lost their lifetime savings,\"" she said. Both Batohi and Lebeya indicated that this will be the first leg of investigations and prosecutions, and that investigations into municipalities, politicians, fixers and businessmen will form the next legs of the investigation.

Coronavirus drug breakthrough  Made in SA and costs only R150 an injection,"A cheap steroid called Dexamethasone, which is available from R149 an injection in South Africa, has been hailed as Coronavirus drug breakthrough treatment to reduce fatalities among severely ill Covid-19 patients. Dexamethasone has been proven to reduced deaths by one-third in patients on ventilators, the University of Oxford said in a statement on Tuesday. It reduced fatalities by a fifth among those who received oxygen support. The finding came from the world?s biggest trial testing existing treatments on Covid-19 patients. More than 11,500 patients in 175 UK hospitals are part of the trial, and more than 2,100 of them received 6mg of dexamethasone once per day. Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed it at the ?biggest breakthrough yet? in the UK?s coronavirus fight. \""It?s a startling result,\"" Kenneth Baillie, an intensive-care physician at the University of Edinburgh, who serves on the steering committee of the trial, told Nature magazine. \""It will clearly have a massive global impact.\"" The regulated price per dexamethasone injection is between R149 and R176 in South Africa. It is typically used to treat arthritis and breathing disorders. South Africa?s pharmaceutical giant Aspen produces dexamethasone injections in South Africa, and its CEO Stephen Saad confirmed to Business Insider SA that there should be sufficient supplies to meet local demand. \""It all depends on where and when we get the surges. We should be fine for South Africa, (as) we make this in South Africa.\"" South Africa faced a shortage of dexamethasone, which is also used to treat leukaemia and terminal brain tumours as recently as in 2016, after Merck & Company discontinued production in SA, the health journalism organisation Bhekisisa reported at the time. Since then Aspen has started production, and other companies including Adcock Ingram and Sanofi are registered to distribute dexamethasone in South Africa. Aspen is also a major supplier of the medicine in other markets, including the UK. \""The other registrations largely in Europe are manufactured there. We were able to largely meet the massive surges in anaesthetics in Europe and we were a major supplier of these products to our European patient base,\"" said Saad. While daily doses of dexamethasone could prevent one in eight ventilated patient deaths and save one out of every 25 patients requiring oxygen, the steroid had no effect on outcomes among those with mild cases of Covid-19 (people not receiving oxygen or ventilation), the study found.",search67,0

2 280 prisoners released and 19 000 more to be released next month,"Over a period of 30 days, 2,280 prisoners were released on parole across SA, and the correctional services department hopes about 19,000 more will be released in the next month. None of these who were released had reoffended. Department spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo told TimesLIVE on Friday morning that the process to release inmates on parole ? in line with plans to reduce overcrowding in prisons as the coronavirus pandemic took hold in SA ? started on May 20. By June 10, the provincial breakdown of approved paroles was: Eastern Cape ? 195; Gauteng ? 374; KwaZulu-Natal ? 586; Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West ? 273; Free State and Northern Cape ? 375; and Western Cape ? 477. \""Placement of benefiting sentenced offenders commenced on May 20 2020, and as on June 10 2020, 2,280 offenders have been placed out. \""The rate of cases considered is expected to increase in the coming weeks,\"" said Nxumalo. Asked when the department hoped to have all estimated 19,000 qualifying parolees assessed and/or released, Nxumalo said the target was July 17. \""The project is scheduled to run over a 10-week period and with placement of qualifying offenders expected to commence from week two to week 10, which is from May 20 2020 to July 17 2020. The schedule provides for placement of qualifying offenders in controllable groups and that vulnerable groups are prioritised. \""The number of placements per week has been gradually increasing from week two, and it is expected that more placement will be achieved during the remaining period, which is more than five weeks. \""The department is working tirelessly to ensure the target date is met while ensuring that the consideration, victim participation and offering of programmes to qualifying offenders are not compromised,\"" he said. As of Thursday night, there were 915 confirmed Covid-19 cases among SA?s prison population, and 510 officials. Nxumalo said these cases did not add extra pressure to move swiftly with the special parole process. \""The department has from the start and always put enough impetus on the special parole dispensation project in that this project requires a sense of urgency in finalising consideration and placements of qualifying offenders to reduce the level of overcrowding and improve social distancing in correctional centres. \""However, the increase in the number of officials and offenders testing positive for Covid-19 has created a stigma against offenders and officials. This is negatively affecting the confirmation of support systems of offenders who are benefiting from the special parole dispensation, in that some families are reluctant to sign for some offenders with fear that upon placement the offenders will infect them,\"" he said.",search67,0

Insiders allegedly told the publication that Conco was instructed by the Zuma family to keep the separation under wraps.ADVERTISING Security personnel at the estate reportedly told the publication that Conco had moved out of her home last December shortly after her last visit from Zuma. Her estranged father, Fartescue Cocnco, confirmed that she has moved to her mother?s home in the Eastern Cape. Nonkanyiso and Fartescue have had a strained relationship since her relationship with the country?s former president went public. This, allegedly due to the fact that Zuma had not shown her family respect by completing all the necessary rites and rituals for their relationship and the two-year-old child they share. Conco made headlines earlier this year after an Instagram post she put up was interpreted to mean that she was raising her son without the help of his father. In an Instagram post addressed to her son, Conco expressed her gratitude to him and said he was the reason she needed to work harder. She said there were circumstances that required the presence of both parents in a child?s life and when one parent was not available to fulfil their duties it caused heart-wrenching pain. She then implored her son to remember that she was a single, young parent who had her own aspirations and dreams, should he find himself in trying circumstances or was engulfed with confusion in future. \""I have made peace with that I?ll attend school activities alone, travel the world with him alone and take all responsibilities on raising a boy child and installing best values in his life,\"" she wrote. According to Sunday Tribune, she later denied painting him as an absent father, claiming it was all a misunderstanding. She told the publication that the post was \""a declaration of a young woman who is marrying a polygamous man\"" and she had made peace that theirs was not an ordinary union. \""Any person with common sense would understand that a man who was a head of state and has such a large family wouldn?t have time for things like walking a child to a park, attending doctor?s appointments or just to buy ice cream at a mall every day,\"" said Conco. \""We all know for a man like Mr Zuma it?s impossible to run family errands every day or to be there for every special day. He missed our son?s first birthday celebration I hosted last year because he was out of the country, but this year could be different. He misses many of our son?s milestones.

MUST READ: Brown vinegar and salt testimonies,"The mystery behind the brown vinegar and salt has got many South Africans talking, while some claim if the mixture is put under the bed, it will enable one to see witches, the truth of the matter is that this mixture is also scientifically warned to be dangerous. Scientists urge people to be careful when using Hydrochloric Acid, which is formed after mixing vinegar and salt. Hydrochloric acid is a hazardous liquid and if come in contact with skin, eyes, or internal organs, the damage can be irreversible or even fatal in severe cases and the use of personal protective equipment is always advised. However, since this issue is trending and can?t seem to leave people?s lips, some claim to have tried putting the mixture under their beds as an experiment, but their testimonies makes one curious and brings fear at the same time. Other claims has it that a mixture of water, vinegar and salt will help remove all the negative energy inside people?s homes. Traditionalists reiterates that though one cannot see the negative energy, doesn?t mean it?s not there. Hence using the mixture of water, vinegar and salt is allegedly a powerful spiritual remedy to counteract the harmful unseen black energy and drain it out of the house. These are all hear say, and whether people really had an encounter with witches at night because of the salt and vinegar mixture cannot be utterly dismissed or believed as the gospel truth as well.

Grades 7 and 12 learners will now only return to school next Monday the 8th of June after the Department of Basic Education conceded that all schools were not ready to open on June 1.

A media briefing by the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga on schools? readiness to resume classes that were scheduled for Sunday night has been postponed till Monday morning at 11am. State of readiness The department says the Council of Education Ministers (CEM) met on Saturday to assess the state of readiness for the reopening of schools where it received several reports indicating that a substantial number of schools were not ready to reopen on Monday. The CEM says it is concerned that in some provinces Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to protect learners against the spread of the coronavirus had not been received, and some schools had not been made ready for the arrival of teachers and learners.

The R350 monthly grant is meant to help the jobless who don?t get any other form of government relief to cope with the lockdown. Sassa acknowledges that the WhatsApp system for applications was flooded with unprecedented numbers of applications per hour, which it struggled to cope with but had to move to other platforms like their website and unstructured supplementary service data (USSD). We received just under 5 million applications for this new grant and we had to compare information provided by applicants with other government and private databases to ensure that people with an income and recipients of other social grants are not included in these applications. In addition, we had to remove duplicated and incomplete applications which account for nearly 50% of all applications received. Up to now, we have eliminated a number of undeserving applicants and this has saved the fiscus close to R14 million which could have sky-rocketed to over R81 million by October. As soon as the vetting of applications is completed, the payments will start rolling in at an even faster pace.

Who is Adriano Mazzotti and what is he known for?,"Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you to grab a chair and a jug of water as my analytic scepticism ruffles up a few feathers. I?m going to unravel a little Mr, by the name of Adriano Mazzotti. So, who is Adriano Mazzotti? Adriano Mazzotti is a director of a cigarette company, Carnilinx, which is under investigation by SARS for smuggling and tax evasion. Like sordid and infernal scenes from a thriller movie, everything about this man is robustly captivating and demands the utmost sobriety to fathom fully. They say \""all are not thieves that dogs bark at\"" but surely if integrity sells for so little, it is only fair that proper analysis is conducted before a conclusion is arrived at. In 2005, Adriano Mazzotti and his ally within the alleged crime clique, Martin Wingate-Pearse, became the target of a massive South African Revenue Services? (SARS) raid on suspicion of drug smuggling. But like any mafia movie, the predictability of the outcome was as the coming of tomorrow ? no drugs were found! Upon realising that he was being investigated by SARS and the SAPS for drug smuggling Mazzotti, via his company Carnilinx, allegedly hired private investigators to gather information on those who were investigating him so as to halt the probes into his tax affairs. To this end a case was subsequently opened by SARS. The Mail & Guardian identified a notorious international fugitive, Antonio Lamas, to be a part of Glenn Agliotti?s group, along with Martin Wingate-Pearse and Adriano Mazzotti. There hasn?t been any remotely robust influence by Mazzotti of high note in the media, other than the raid on his home and his questionable relations to Glenn Agliotti. On the other hand considering that he?s in the cigarette company, similarly as Glenn was, leaves a lot of questions unanswered. It is almost as if Mazotti was being groomed to fill in the big underworld shoes that was used by Glenn. After-all, you?re only as good as the company you keep. His sudden political interests are rather eyebrow raising of note. Glenn was linked to President Mbeki, and Mazzotti told City Press that he is good friends with EFF President, Julius Malema, after admitting that he gave Julius R200 000 to register his party for elections. To an ordinary South African, that is an awful lot of money. It is enough to guarantee a prolonged life that is somewhat hunger-free. To the rich underworld individuals, R200 000 merely amounts to a water droplet in a pond. Did the then-estranged Juju?s loyalty cost such peanuts, or is there actually a lot more to this than meets the eye? This pattern is almost monotonous, but the denouement and climax of the plot always tend to slightly alter. Now here?s the cinema part, one which I feel Mazzotti must account for before seeking to further himself in Glenn?s footsteps. Belinda Walter was the attorney for Carnilinx. Carnilinx Director, Kyle Philip, claimed British American Tobacco (BAT) paid Belinda Walter to spy on Carnilinx and leak information to them. Later on, Belinda did the 360 degrees turn and quit as attorney for Carnilinx only to date Van Loggerenberg, the head of SARS investigating her former client Carnilinx. The \""surprise\"" was convenient for Carnilinx, not so? After the alleged probing or spying on those investigating him, it looked like he finally found a sink-hole. Thus emerged an evidently well orchestrated commotion of enigma whereby the art of pointing fingers at each other cancelled out the important matter at hand. It was as much a circus as that occurring in parliament. Playfulness and confusion played the role of a smoke screen. Carnilinx claimed that Belinda Walter fed information about them to SARS and Belinda Walter claimed that Carnilinx was offered tax leniency in exchange for filing the application against her. So for a person who claims to serve the people, what exactly is Julius Malema doing with Adriano Mazzotti? This Julius, an orator and facetious comedian, seeks to find friendships with all the bad guys ? just like those girls loving bad boys. For a nay singer, he surely strikes as a type to sing out of tune when the shoe is on the other foot. The matter of note is that Adriano Mazzotti managed, in one way or the other, to influence judgement on his SARS investigation. Glenn Agliotti is a free man today. Malema is cleared of sequestration. Really, these are the kind of things that only happen in the movies. Julius, the agent of London and the water boy of the underworld ? a pipeline link between international might, monarchy and international drug dealings. It is time we open our eyes South Africans.

SASSA media statement on payment of R350 special grants under Level 3 lockdown,"Today SASSA issued a media statement on payment of R350 special grants. The statement was issued as follows: Level 3 lockdown announcement enables faster payment of COVID-19 grants Sunday?s announcement by His Excellency President Matamela Ramaphosa in response to the Corona virus epidemic brings much needed hope to the country. It also enables SASSA to accelerate the pace of paying out the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant. In terms of the move to level 3 of the lockdown, government services will commence full reopening from 01 June 2020. At the moment SASSA is operating with a third of its staff during level 4 and a move to level 3 will increase human resource capacity drastically so that payments are made quicker than it is the case currently. Much progress has been made in preparing for the payment of large numbers of the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grants. SASSA started using WhatsApp for applications but had to move to other platforms like the srd.sassa.gov.za website and Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). This was after the WhatsApp system was flooded with unprecedented numbers of applications per hour, which it struggled to cope with. The situation was also further challenged by the fact that applicants tried to upload supporting documents through the various platforms, despite this not being necessary. All these application channels have been stabilised and the application process is now significantly smoother. After increasing capacity of the application channels, SASSA moved swiftly to testing the payment side of its system. A sample of 10 beneficiaries was used to test the efficacy of the payment mechanism and 9 were successfully paid. One applicant had captured his banking details incorrectly. This has since been corrected. This payment test should be seen for what it is. Just under 5 million applications have been received and this figure includes duplications, incomplete and invalid applications. Some applicants were sent messages to provide banking details and they are requested to respond as quickly so that they can be paid before month end. Unbanked applicants will be paid through money send using an ATM of their choice. SASSA will finalise contracting for this facility with the banks today so that such payments can be made this week. Beneficiaries can also open accounts at their nearest post office. It was important for SASSA to only start paying out this grant after tight systems have been established and tested to avoid wasteful expenditure and fraud. It has not been as easy as it has been made out to be in media circles due to the dependencies along the value chain The mammoth task of ensuring that the correct and deserving individuals are paid has started in earnest. This process involved intense negotiations with institutions in the value chain and this unfortunately accounted for the delays that were encountered. These delays proved to be worth it, given the number of applicants that could be excluded during the process as they are either in receipt of social grants or UIF ? two factors which expressly disqualify applicants from receiving this grant. SASSA CEO Totsie Memela however extended an unreserved apology to those inconvenienced by the slower than expected process. \""We received just under 5 million applications for this new grant and we had to compare information provided by applicants with other government and private databases to ensure that people with an income and recipients of other social grants are not included in these applications. In addition, we had to remove duplicated and incomplete applications which account for nearly 50% of all applications received.

As soon as the vetting of applications is completed, the payments will start rolling in at an even faster pace\"". Citizens are reminded that no applications for the special COVID-19 relief grant will be taken at SASSA offices because only electronic applications are accepted. In order to comply with the restrictions on services during level 4 of the lockdown, SASSA local offices have specific dates on which they attend to selected grants. On Mondays and Tuesdays local offices strictly attend to applications for Old Age Grants On Wednesdays and Thursdays local offices strictly attend to applications for Child Support Grants and foster child grants.

Missing 27-year old Nurse found buried in her boyfriends backyard in Limpopo,"A 27-year old nursing graduate?s body has been found buried in a shallow grave in her boyfriend?s backyard five months after she went missing.

Only 10 people were paid their R350 SASSA grant from Five million applicants,"The DA on Friday called on social development minister Lindiwe Zulu to take responsibility after the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) was only able to pay the R350 social distress grant to 10 people. \""The department and Sassa seemingly misled the nation when they indicated that payments for this grant would commence on May 15 2020. Clearly they are in over their heads and do not have a handle on this special grant,\"" said the DA?s shadow minister of social development, Bridget Masango. She said the revelation was made in parliament on Thursday when the DA asked Sassa CEO Busisiwe Memela-Khambula how many recipients had been paid. \""Instead of answering the question, she proceeded to give a long-winded explanation on vetting applicants and testing the system,\"" said Masango. Masango slammed Sassa, which had more than three weeks to plan, verify and approve a significant proportion of the applications. \""The DA acknowledges that it is no small feat to vet and approve 3.5-million people in a short time, the reality is that the president announced the special Covid-19 social relief of distress grant on April 21. It is ridiculous that only 10 people have received this grant and no amount of spin will justify this mammoth failure on the part of minister Zulu and CEO Memela-Khambula,\"" she said. Sassa spokesperson Sandy Godlwana said she was unable to comment on grant-related queries and referred queries to another spokesperson, Paseka Letsatsi, who could not be reached at the time of publishing. Speaking to SAfm, Memela-Khambula said the agency had received more than 4.5- million applications, following which 2.6-million had been verified. \""Once we receive the application, we have to ensure there are no duplications from people trying to double-up. We then have to check if our applicants receive any other social grants. We then send that data to Sars to make sure that people that are actually going to get the money are not already receiving a salary. So that?s the process that makes it to have taken so long in terms of where we are,\"" she said. Memela-Khambula confirmed only 10 people had been paid thus far, but said the agency was ready to pay 100,000 people after they had loaded their banking details on their system. \""We are excited to say that past week we did a test trial, and paid a few people to make sure that the system works and we?ve now sent SMSes to 100,000 people that we?re ready to pay, so they can load their bank accounts because the key thing for us for us is to ensure that people load their accounts in an environment that is safe,\"" she said. However, Masango said the non-payment was an indication of how the government continues to neglect the poor. \""Not only do they try to prevent NGOs from distributing food to the poor, but they also make it almost impossible for desperate people to get the meagre R350 relief. Sassa has so far failed to fully rise to the challenge of supporting those in need. ?The DA calls on minister Zulu to take full responsibility for her department?s poor showing,\"" said Masango. Memela-Khambula said the agency intended making the payments continuously and not on fixed dates like other grants. She said over time, the process will become quicker.",search67,0
Grandmother spends 2 days in SASSA office queue without being helped,"Cape Town ? \""I couldn?t feel my feet any more because I only had a blanket and a piece of cardboard to sleep on in the cold,\"" said a Khayelitsha grandmother who slept outside her local Sassa office since Tuesday to be assisted. Hundreds of Khayelitsha Hundreds of Khayelitsha residents desperately queued for assistance yesterday, with many having slept there the nights before to secure a spot. With the Sassa Eerste River office closed after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19, residents travelled to Khayelitsha to be helped. The 52-year-old Site B resident said she left home early on Tuesday morning with hopes of being assisted with her grandchild?s social grant. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said her grandchildren had to bring her a blanket as she saw that the day was passing with no hope of being assisted. \""I was surprised to see the time moving with no one saying anything to us, and we figured we would have to sleep there and be the first ones on Wednesday. \""Little did we know that we would have to sleep there for a second day after people who were left over from the previous week arrived and were put in front (of the queue),\"" she said. The grandmother said the officials only took 60 people a day and the rest had to go back home and come back again, depending on the services they required. \""I haven?t been assisted,\"" she said yesterday. \""I can?t come back tomorrow because they only deal with social grants on Wednesdays and Thursdays. \""I will have to come back again next week and hopefully be assisted,\"" she said. Sassa spokesperson Shivani Wahab said the Khayelitsha office had experienced a high influx of clients since operations resumed on May 11. She said in line with the government?s phased reopening of the economy, Sassa offices across the country currently operated with a third of the total staff capacity. \""Despite introducing measures to restrict a high number of clients from accessing Sassa contact points and to restrict overcrowding, the Khayelitsha local office receives approximately 600 applications per day,\"" she said. Wahab said a queue management system and an appointment system were in place and all clients at the contact point were duly assisted. \""The Sassa Eerste River office has been temporarily closed in the week for sanitising due to a staff member testing positive for Covid19. \""This has resulted in some of the Eerste River clients accessing the Sassa Khayelitsha local office for assistance,\"" she said.

Live News | Tobacco and alcohol ban to continue until Level 1: Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma,"Cooperative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has told the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) that the sale of tobacco and alcohol should continue to be banned until the country reaches Level 1 of the lockdown. News24 was reliably told that Dlamini-Zuma was supported by Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi when she told the NCCC this week that she believed it would be too much of a health risk to allow the sale of cigarettes and alcohol on 1 June when the country is expected to go to Level 3 of the nationwide lockdown. This prompted a debate in the meeting, chaired by President Cyril Ramaphosa, with no resolution on the matter. A high-ranking insider with intimate knowledge of the meeting said Dlamini-Zuma had come prepared with academic papers that argued against the sale of tobacco and alcohol during the Covid-19 pandemic, citing health risks. President Cyril Ramaphosa has rubbished claims that there is any agenda from government in the banning of tobacco products during the Covid-19 Level 4 national lockdown. This is despite an agreement that government would lift the restrictions on the sale of tobacco under Level 3. Those who opposed the proposal led by Dlamini-Zuma argued that a pandemic was not the time to make policy decisions, as both the tobacco and alcohol industries were not banned ? they were simply regulated. ?There is no finality? A reliable insider said that even Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, who initially supported the ban, seemed to have come to terms with the fact that cigarettes and alcohol should be allowed with strict conditions under Level 3. There was no decision on the matter, the source said. \""The discussion goes on and on and there is no finality,\"" the insider said. This is not the first time the NCCC has heard lively discussions around the ban on tobacco and alcohol. An announcement by Ramaphosa to allow the sale of those products under Level 4 was rescinded days later after vehement opposition led by Dlamini-Zuma. The Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association has challenged government?s decision in court, and the Presidency and Dlamini-Zuma have until next Tuesday to provide the record of the decision and the reasons why tobacco was banned in the first place. Dlamini-Zuma?s spokesperson Mlungisi Mtshali said he could not comment on matters currently before the NCCC. Efforts to get comment from Motsoaledi were also unsuccessful. This will be added should News24 receive it. The NCCC has also heard arguments calling for the reopening of hairdressers and salons under Level 3. It was argued that women, who are the majority in that industry, were at risk of losing their livelihoods. More than 8 000 people have made inputs to government calling for the reopening of salons and hairdressers. While the matter is still unresolved, it is understood that there seemed to be an indication that there would be \""enhanced regulations\"" if salons were to reopen. Another point of contention before the NCCC is the opening of restaurants under strict \""protocols\"". While takeaways and drive-thrus will be open under Level 3, there is a contention that sit-down restaurants should be open. The NCCC finally agreed that there would be limited domestic air travel under Level 3, with hotels and licenced accommodation allowed to operate to assist businesses. This too would come with strict conditions. What is allowed The NCCC?s members seemed to be in agreement that all manufacturing, mining, agriculture, forestry and fisheries would be opened under Level 3. All retail would also be opened, with some restrictions. It was further agreed that the construction industry would be reopened and that all other supporting jobs would also be allowed. The maritime industry is expected to reopen, with the exception of cruises. Sources told News24 that there was uncertainty whether the risk-adjusted approach of having different districts in different levels would be effective in the metros around the country. \""We said people will just drive to another district for what they can?t get under Level 4,\"" a second source noted. It was argued that having districts close by on different alert levels would be difficult to enforce. Earlier this week, Gauteng Premier David Makhura said Gauteng as a whole would move to Level 3 and would not move between levels of the lockdown in a disjointed manner. The technical support team of the NCCC, known as Natjoints, is expected to finalise this in the coming days. Mkhize?s plan for the next phase of the government?s response to curbing the spread of Covid-19 includes a ward-based response, which will see people being employed to enforce mask wearing and social distancing, while others would screen people in wards across the country. The NCCC is expected to meet again next Tuesday and, in the meantime, the agreed upon regulations are being finalised by the relevant departments.

France forced to re-close schools as coronavirus symptoms increase in number or intensity.,"Schools in France opened with a restriction of 15 children per class. As some parts of the world begin a journey of opening up societies after weeks of hard lockdowns implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus, data from places that have opened up is beginning to emerge. About 40 000 preschool and primary school children returned to school in France with classes only allowed to have e15 students per class. A week after schools in France went back to school, the country has been forced to reclose them as they have seen flare-ups of 70 cases of the virus which are thought to be linked to schools. It was however not immediately clear if the 70 cases of COVID-19 were among students or teachers. According to French education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, \""The return has put some children in new danger of contamination. He said the affected schools are being closed immediately. French media reported that seven schools in northern France were closed. Given that the incubation period for the virus is several days, people are \""likely\"" to have been infected before the reopening of the schools.\""",search67,0
More than 100 000 citizens agree with Maimane that Schools should stay closed for another 3 months,"One SA Movement leader Mmusi Maimane has received over 100 000 signatures on his petition to reverse the decision by the Department of Education to reopen schools from 1 June. Concerns have been raised about the safety of children returning to school fro the first time since before the Easter break in march due to the rising number of COVID-19 infections in South Africa, and Maimane thinks they should remain shut for the next three months. ?SCHOOLS COULD BECOME PETRI DISHES? Maimane said that the reopening of schools is a \""rushed and ill-advised\"" decision that could place teachers, pupils and parents in jeopardy. \""In light of the increasing rise in cases of COVID-19 infections, the decision by Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, to reopen all schools on 1 June 2020 is a risky and dangerous gamble with the lives of our nation?s young people,\"" Maimane wrote. \""As a father and an uncle, I fundamentally disagree with this rushed and ill-advised decision. Therefore I?m calling on all South Africans ? including teachers, parents, principals and SGBs ? to make their voices heard on this matter of national importance and join us in our call for the Minister to reverse this unwise decision.\"" He said that by bringing pupils, teachers back into the school environment while the peak of infections was still on the horizon, the department is risking an undoing of the efforts produced during the lockdown period to stem the spread of the virus. \""We maintain that opening schools at this stage poses a risk and danger to all students, teachers and support staff as all credible indicators suggest that infections have not yet peaked.\"" \""We cannot risk allowing our country?s places of learning to become petri dishes for increases in infections which may undo the value of the national lockdown.\"" ?KEEP SCHOOLS SHUT? Instead, Maimane is advocating for schools to remain closed for the next three months while healthcare systems continue to manage the daily increases in cases. \""Our proposal for schools to remain closed for a further three-month period is the most sensible choice. This will allow every school sufficient time to implement a \""Roadmap to Reopening\"" ? a checklist of prerequisites that must be satisfied before any school is declared safe to reopen.\"" He criticised Motshekga for seemingly neglecting to consider the rights of children during this uncertain period. \""Section 28(2) of our Constitution states that \""a child?s best interests are of paramount importance in every matter concerning the child\"". The Minister gave very little reassurance that her decision adheres to this fundamental right,\"" he said. With severe pressure on thousands of underfunded schools to ensure that their premises are sanitised and ready for the return of pupils and staff, Maimane questioned whether they would cope. \""Based on the Minister?s address and the data at hand, it seems highly unlikely all 24 000 schools across South Africa, many without basic infrastructure and water supply, will be COVID-proof within the coming days.\"" At time of writing, the petition had 112 771 signatures in total.

Pitso Mosimane extended his contract in Sundowns by 4 years,"Mamelodi Sundowns Coach Pitso Mosimane signed a contract extension with the South African champions which will extend his stay for another four years up to the end of the 2023/2024 season. \""Mosimane, who joined ?The Brazilians? in the middle of the 2012/13 season has gone on to be the most decorated coach in South Africa ? and with the new deal, will cement his place as the longest serving coach at the Club,\"" a statement on the club website read. The club?s announcement ends the speculation that Mosimane would leave the defending league champions due to a number of issues including rising tensions with the club management and disputes in hiring of personnel. Some local media outlets have even gone as far as reporting on potential candidates who could take over from the 55-year-old. Sundowns responded just over a week ago dismissing the speculation adding that it will communicate an official position when appropriate. Mosimane said he was honoured and humbled to given an opportunity to extend his stay at Sundowns. \""One of the main reasons for me to renew my contract with Mamelodi Sundowns is the President?s trust and faith in me, he trusted me to lead this team to where it is ? and fulfill his wish to build a team to conquer Africa. It?s humbling to be part of a brand like Sundowns and contribute to its success, especially as a local coach and also having played for the team,\"" he said. Mosimane added that he intended to ensure that the 2016 African champions will always be competing for trophies in domestic and continental competitions. \""I believe it?s important for a club like Sundowns to constantly challenge for the Absa Premiership and CAF competitions, we need to win the Champions League ? and it?s a big thing. No one wins it easily, we are focused on this.\"" Mosimane said that some of the things he would like to achieve with the team would be to win the MTN8 tournament, one of the only trophies he has not won with Sundowns, and strengthen the club?s youth development system. \""We need to keep promoting young talent from our development. We have been successful in the past, that?s what I want to see happening more. Bringing Percy Tau up from our Youth Development and seeing him flourish in Europe is incredible,\"" he said. Mosimane has been in charge of Mamelodi Sundowns since 2012.

Niece | Bishop Zondo raped me three times 40 years ago: Rape case opened last week,"Rivers of Living Waters Ministries International leader Bishop Bafana Zondo?s niece has added another rape docket to the bible-puncher?s ever-growing bible of rape cases. Sunday World can sensationally reveal that Zondo?s niece, who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleged that Zondo raped her at least three times 40 years ago and tried to buy her silence with a R1 coin and sweets. The woman opened a case of rape against the bishop at the Booysens police station last week Friday and the docket was transferred to the Evaton police station for investigation. In a police statement, which Sunday World has seen, the 46-year-old woman, who now lives in De Deur, alleged that Zondo, who was 14 years old then, plundered her at her grandmother?s house in Sebokeng, south of Joburg, in 1980 when she was just six years old. Relating the ordeal, the woman said she was living with her grandmother Alina Zondo in May 1980. She said her grandmother, who was preggies at the time, went to her parent?s place when she was suffering from pregnancy-related complications, leaving her under the care of Zondo. She said she was playing outside the house with other children when Zondo, whom she referred to as \""Uncle Fani Zondo\"", invited her into one of the bedrooms. She alleged that while inside the house, Zondo asked her to wash his socks and ordered her playmates not to enter the bedroom. \""He told her to climb onto the bed and he pulled her legs, undressing her and himself. He started playing with his penis, put Vaseline [petroleum] on his penis and around her vagina. He then penetrated inside her vagina [sic],\"" reads the statement. The woman also said when she screamed, he took out his penis and told her not to scream. He then penetrated her again. \""The complainant screamed louder and he stopped and ordered her not to tell anyone and gave her R1 coin and many sweets.

Umalusi ? the body that has to ensure matric examinations meet the required standards ? briefed the basic education committees of both houses of Parliament on Tuesday. While it is unclear how the Covid-19 pandemic is going to affect matric examinations, it seems set in stone that the class of 2020 will be tested on the whole curriculum. Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande told reporters on Saturday that they have done all they can to ensure that students are able to get their materials and get online. Rakometsi said, from a quality assurance perspective, they couldn?t water down the curriculum. \""They must know what other students have always known. \""What won?t change, is the work students will be tested on.\"" He said cutting the curriculum would stigmatise the class of 2020. \""These students will be condemned for the rest of their lives\"". Contingency plans Rakometsi told the virtual meeting that they had regular meetings on the matter, and also with the Department on Basic Education. So far the pandemic had affected their budget, as they had to spend money on things they had not budgeted for, like personal protective equipment. He said they had contingency plans and were continuously looking at the situation. \""Unfortunately the situation is fluid, as we all know,\"" he said. Umalusi Council chairperson John Volmink said: \""Covid-19 could not have come at a worse time for an organisation like Umalusi.\"" He said they had a responsibility to conduct credible exams. They would have a special meeting on Friday, Volmink said, adding that Covid-19 had thrown most of their plans into disarray.

In her latest rant, controversial poet and musician Ntsiki Mazwai has accused gay men of having what she calls \""vagina envy.\"" This after she shared her theory that renowned choreographer-turned-reality star, Somizi Mhlongo, set up his Comedy Central Roast, featuring her on the panel, as a way to \""kill her brand.\"" \""Alpha females are a problem for gay men,\"" tweeted Mazwai. She then ventured to ask the public why they think this is, before berating a Twitter user who recalled Nomzamo Mbatha?s roast of Mazwai. It wasn?t long before Mazwai?s claims were met with an avalanche of rebuttals. \""Nomzamo\"" went on to top the Twitter trends list as many sought to find out exactly what was wrong with the way Mbatha roasted Mazwai, given the nature of the show. Others expressed the opinion that what Mbatha did is no different from what Mazwai does on her Twitter feed on a regular basis. She later promised to \""spill the tea\"" and recorded her version of events regarding the roast in a video filmed while she was taking her morning walk. IOL reports that Mazwai believes the real reason that Mbatha has an alleged hatred for her is due to the fact that Mbatha is now managed by Mazwai?s former manager, Pumza Nohashe. \""You wanted the real story behind the roast.

France reports 70 new cases in schools a week after reopening their schools,"France has recorded 70 new cases in schools that were allowed to reopen last week, the country?s education minister said on Monday. France closed its school and higher education institutes from March 17 as part of the country?s measures to contain the country?s coronavirus outbreak. France had recorded over 180,000 cases and more than 28,000 deaths as of May 18. After two months of lockdown, France has begun to lift restrictions, including the reopening of some shops and preschools and elementary schools. According to France24, classes have been capped at 10 students for preschools and 15 students for other age groups. Despite social distancing measures in classes, some kids have caught the disease. Education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer told French radio station RTL on Monday that 70 new cases of Covid-19 had been detected in the week since students came back, which he said was \""inevitable.\"" \""It?s inevitable this sort of thing will happen,\"" he said. \""In almost all cases, this [transmission] has happened outside of the school.\"" Blanquer noted that the 70 cases were a small proportion of the 1.4 million schoolchildren who have returned. He said the affected schools would be closed immediately. France is among several European countries, including Germany, Denmark, Norway, the Czech Republic, and Poland, that have started to lift lockdown measures, though many have warned that the process will be slow and closely monitored. Denmark became the first European country to reopen schools last month, prompting parents to raise concerns that their children were being used as \""guinea pigs\"" to test government policies. Still, European officials have downplayed the risks of sending kids back to school, saying that the alternative would be more harmful to students in the long run. \""There will be terrible damage if we lose a generation of children who have been stopped from going to school for several months,\"" Blanquer said, according to The Guardian. On Monday, Bla?enka Divjak, the minister for education in Croatia, said at a press conference that there hasn?t been a significant increase in cases since European schools opened their doors. \""So far we haven?t heard anything negative about the reopening of schools but it is probably too early to have final conclusions on that,\"" she said.",search67,0

The royal family wants all six of King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebos children to undergo paternity tests.,"Battle for abaThembu throne hots up as Buyelekhaya demands his son take a DNA test In a new twist to the ongoing saga involving the abaThembu nation in the Eastern Cape, a faction of the royal family wants all six of King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo?s children to undergo paternity tests. Earlier this week, Buyelekhaya caused a stir when he disowned his son, acting king Azenathi Dalindyebo, and suggested that a DNA test be conducted to prove that Azenathi was really his child. This marks an all-time low in their relationship and the culmination of tensions between them which had built up following the senior monarch?s release from jail in December. Since then, the two have been locked in a tussle for the throne. Azenathi had been appointed as acting king from the time Buyelekhaya was sentenced to a 12-year prison term for arson, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. He was incarcerated in December 2015. Azenathi was installed as acting king by the abaThembu in November 2016. This was officially recognised by government in February 2017. Although Buyelekhaya had initially wanted Azenathi to act as regent when he went to jail, he changed his mind prior to his incarceration and endorsed one of his wives, Queen Nokwanda, to take over. \""NOW THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHEN HE HAS IMPREGNATED A WOMAN, TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN IN FUTURE AND [HAVING] OUR KINGDOM EMBARRASSED LIKE THIS, WE WANT THE KING TO SUBJECT ALL SIX OF HIS CHILDREN TO A DNA TEST\""_ Nkosi Thandisizwe Mtirara However, the amaDlomo (the core royal family) had already accepted Azenathi and argued that, as the king?s eldest son, he was the rightful person to take over. Now, following Buyelekhaya?s release from prison in December, after a remission of sentence was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the two remain locked in a tug of war over who the legitimate king is. This week, presumably frustrated at seeing his son continuing to enjoy all the benefits that come with being acting king, Buyelekhaya threw a spanner in the works by claiming that Azenathi was not his biological child. He demanded that the acting king undergo DNA testing and told him to vacate the royal residence at Bumbane Great Place, near Mthatha. This is not the first time the king has demanded his son leave the royal palace. In March, City Press reported that Buyelekhaya stormed Bumbane Great Place in the middle of the night and allegedly chased away the acting king and his wife. He was arrested the following day and appeared in the Mthatha Magistrates? Court, where he was released on a warning. He is due to appear in court again on June 1. On Friday, responding on Azenathi?s behalf, the amaDlomo royal family said he would agree to go for a DNA test on condition that all six of the children fathered by Buyelekhaya and his three wives also did so. The family said this was to prevent a future situation in which the king could disown one of his children. \""WE ARE NOT SHAKING OR WAVERING ON THE FACT THAT HE IS OUR SON\""_ Prince Siganeko Dalindyebo, Buyelekhaya?s younger brother and Azenathi?s uncle Addressing a media briefing at Bumbane Great Place, Nkosi Thandisizwe Mtirara said of Buyelekhaya: \""Now that he does not know when he has impregnated a woman, to prevent this from happening again in future and [having] our kingdom embarrassed like this, we want the king to subject all six of his children to a DNA test. \""As the royal family, we are going to monitor that and make sure it is carried through.\"" Prince Siganeko Dalindyebo, Buyelekhaya?s younger brother and Azenathi?s uncle, who supports the acting king, said it was unfortunate that the Thembu nation was still involved in \""a media circus as a result of poverty thinking\"", adding that this was undermining the existence of the kingship as an institution. He said it was unnecessary for Azenathi to be disowned by his father. \""But we are not surprised because this is something that Zwelibanzi [Buyelekhaya] has been using throughout his reign as a weapon of fighting. \""Within the family, we have come to know that when there are issues, our legitimacy in the lineage of Dalindyebo will be questioned. It is time that this stopped. Here we are, faced with maintaining the legacy and dignity of King Thembu himself, the founder of the kingdom,\"" he said. The prince added that such tendencies sowed divisions within the nation, and this would not be allowed to continue unabated. \""Zanelizwe [Azenathi], we are not shaking or wavering on the fact that he is our son,\"" he said. He said Buyelekhaya had not raised any issues with the relevant structures within the abaThembu nation before hanging his \""dirty linen\"" in public. Siganeko praised Azenathi for having brought stability to the amaThembu in the three years, and counting, that he had been at the helm, adding that the abaThembu must continue to develop. \""IF AZENATHI IS STILL GETTING SOME BENEFITS FROM GOVERNMENT, THAT WOULD BE CORRUPTION ? BECAUSE HIS CONTRACT AS ACTING KING EXPIRED ON MARCH\""_ Babalo Papu, Buyelekhaya?s spokesperson \""We also explain that Zanelizwe is intact and is in high spirits, happy and jovial. This whole thing has not bothered him. He is just concerned that his dignity and image are being dragged through the mud. \""This is something that we also do not want. We are not about causing a rift between father and son, but that is what his [Buyelekhaya?s] clique and cabal are doing. Our duty is to unite the house of Dalindyebo,\"" he said. He said talks between Buyelekhaya and the amaDlomo royal family had collapsed. Babalo Papu, Buyelekhaya?s spokesperson and confidante, said the king still held a certificate of recognition for the kingdom of abaThembu, and this had never been revoked. He said that there was only one king of the Thembu nation and that Azenathi?s term as acting regent had lapsed in March. Papu said Azenathi had no business occupying the king?s seat or deriving any of the benefits that were due to Buyelekhaya. \""The ruling king currently is king Zwelibanzi Dalindyebo; there is no doubt about that. If Azenathi is still getting some benefits from government, that would be corruption ? because his contract as acting king expired on March 8. That means anything that goes to him from government is corruption and needs to be looked into by law enforcement,\"" said Papu. He said the king did not have a problem with all of his children undergoing DNA testing, but he wanted Azenathi?s test to be done as a matter of urgency.",search67,0

Of the 250,000 who applied via e-mail, half were flagged and removed as they already received social grants. From midday on Monday, Sassa launched a new application system to ensure that only those eligible would receive assistance and to stop chancers from defrauding the system. Here are the criteria for the grant: Any unemployed South African older than 18. Must not be a recipient of other social grants, including old age, child support or disability grants. Applicants should not be earning any sort of income. Recipients of NSFAS funding do not qualify. Prisoners and all other beneficiaries of state-funded welfare do not qualify. Memela said those who qualify must be able to produce their SA identity document details in full as well as their gender and disability, if any. The provision of physical address details, even without proof of residence, was also required. Since the lockdown was announced, humanitarian organisation Scientology Volunteer Ministers has sanitised the equivalent of 658 football fields in Gauteng to protect South Africans from the pandemic. The group works tirelessly to decontaminate buildings and vehicles used by the public. To date the group has decontaminated over 3 million square metres. Active bank account details were also required to enable Sassa to deposit the money once an application was approved. Those without an active bank account can use their mobile phone numbers for cardless withdrawals at bank ATMs.",search67,0

German brewery is giving away unsold beers for free to German Citizens,"German brewery is giving away unsold beers for free to German Citizens WILLINGEN, Germany (Reuters) ? Unable to deliver to hotels and restaurants closed due to restrictions, a German brewery on Thursday gave away some 2,600 litres (690 gallons) of beer. Rather than throwing it away, the owners of the Willinger brewery, in the western state of Hesse, decided to dish out the light and dark beer free of charge. Owner Franz Mast said he needed to empty the tanks as soon as possible to fill them up again with fresh beer and be ready for when bars are allowed to reopen. The move went down well. Dozens of people stood patiently in line outside the brewery, wearing masks and keeping to social distancing recommendations. Many took full buckets and boxes back home. \""We also want to thank people, and we hope they are as supportive once we reopen, that they come here, recommend us,\"" Mast told Reuters Television. The Deutsche Brauer Bund beer association has warned that brewers are facing a collapse in sales due to a slump in exports, especially to China and Italy. The lockdown at home, meanwhile, has left restaurants and bars shut and football stadiums empty. Bavaria?s Oktoberfest, the world?s biggest beer festival, has been cancelled. The brewery had initially planned to give out 540 litres on Thursday, but that amount was gone within hours. \""I hope it helps the brewery, that is why we are here. This way, we can sit in the garden later today, in the sun, and have a nice Willinger beer,\"" said customer Natalie Julius.

President Ramaphosa authorises release of low-risk prisoners to combat spread in prisons,"President Cyril Ramaphosa has authorised the parole of selected categories of sentenced inmates as a measure to combat the spread in prisons, which are considered high-risk areas for infection. In a statement on Friday, the Presidency said the parole dispensation would apply to low-risk inmates who have already served their minimum sentence, or who would approach this period in the next five years. Prisoners affected by this decision will not be pardoned or have their sentences remitted, instead, they will be placed on parole and will continue to serve their sentence under community corrections until they reach their respective sentence expiry dates. Some prisoners at Port Elizabeth?s St Albans Maximum Prison set alight objects at the prison this week demanding cigarettes and court dates as lockdown regulations take its toll. \""This dispensation excludes inmates sentenced to life imprisonment or serving terms for specified other serious crimes, including sexual offences, murder and attempted murder, gender-based violence and child abuse,\"" the statement reads. The decision by the president could relieve correctional facilities of just under 19 000 inmates out of a population of 155 000, according to the Presidency. The Presidency further explained that these parolees may be rearrested and ultimately reincarcerated if they violate their release conditions. \""The placement of qualifying sentenced offenders will take place over a 10-week period and will commence as soon as all Parole Board processes have been finalised and all relevant rehabilitation and pre-release programmes are attended. \""The President has taken this decision in terms of Section 82(1)(a) of the Correctional Services Act of 1998 which empowers the President to authorise at any time the placement on correctional supervision or parole of any sentenced prisoner, subject to conditions that may be recommended by the Correctional Supervision and Parole Board,\"" the statement reads. Ramaphosa took this decision in response to a call by the United Nations to all countries to reduce prison populations so that social distancing and self-isolation conditions can be observed during this period. \""In South Africa, as in many other countries, correctional facilities have witnessed outbreaks of coronavirus infections among inmates and personnel. \""A number of countries across the world have already heeded the call by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and have released a number of offenders in detention.\"" Justice Minister Ronald Lamola is expected to provide more details on the parole placement programme in a public briefing, the Presidency said. This will take place on Friday afternoon at 13:30. As of 7 May, the Department of Correctional Services said there were 172 confirmed cases at various prisons across the country. Correctional centres in the Eastern Cape have been the worst affected, with 102 confirmed cases, most of which come from the East London prison where a number of officials and inmates tested positive for the virus.",search67,0
Vodacom launches Africas first live 5G mobile network in South Africa,"VODACOM Customers with devices capable of accessing the network can now subscribe to 5G services in South Africa through Vodacom. The network, which supports both mobile and fixed-wireless access, was built by both Liquid Telecom, with Vodacom roaming on the infrastructure, and by Vodacom itself, thanks to recently assigned spectrum from communications regulator Icasa. \""Vodacom has switched on Africa?s first live 5G mobile network in three cities ? Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town ? with further roll-outs planned in other parts of the country,\"" the operator said on Monday. Existing 4G tariffs for mobile and fixed-wireless will initially apply to Vodacom?s 5G service offering, with special 5G tariffs to be announced in due course \""This network will support both mobile and fixed-wireless services and is currently available on 20 live 5G sites, 18 of which are in Gauteng and two in Cape Town,\"" it said. Vodacom said it was able to fast-track the launch of 5G thanks to recently assigned temporary spectrum from Icasa for the duration of the national state of disaster related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The spectrum includes 50MHz in the 3.5GHz band, which was used to fast-track the network?s launch. TechCentral reported in December 2019 that Vodacom and Liquid Telecom had also concluded managed network services and national roaming agreements for a national 5G network, which forms part of the offering. The operator expects to expand its initial 5G roll-out as more smartphones, Wi-Fi and fixed-wireless routers become available. The current 5G network equipment deployed also operates in the same frequency bands which are expected to be permanently assigned through an auction later in the year, said group CEO Shameel Joosub in a statement. \""Existing 4G tariffs for mobile and fixed-wireless will initially apply to Vodacom?s 5G service offering, with special 5G tariffs to be announced in due course,\"" he said.

"SASSA Grant payment errors leave many without cash, while some get paid double","The SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) was hit by accidental double payments in some areas, and no payments in others, due to glitches in the system as it tried to make payment days less crowded by extending the dates. KwaZulu-Natal Sassa spokesperson Sandy Godlwana said some beneficiaries had found that their money was not available. She said that some recipients in the Western Cape had been paid double by mistake. \""It?s Western Cape that has an issue of double payments. We didn?t have an issue of double payments, but we had an issue of people not receiving the payment,\"" she said. \""We apologise, it was an inconvenience for them.\"" However, people can go and fetch their money from 15:00 on Monday afternoon from merchant banks or the Post Office. They can also get their money on Tuesday morning if they prefer. Godlwana said that Sassa?s intention was to prevent pensioners and the disabled from being exposed to large crowds during the coronavirus pandemic, and that they were only trying to help when they set aside the special days for these categories of beneficiary. They are not yet sure what caused the glitch. Comment from the national Sassa spokesperson was not immediately available and spokespersons for the Department of Social Development were also asked for further information. According to Voice of the Cape, approximately 435 000 people in the Western Cape received duplicate payments, which were now being reversed. Two Post Office employees in the Western Cape told News24 that they had found out that something was amiss when at least five beneficiaries said they had tried to use their cards at a supermarket, but that the money was not showing in their accounts, or that they had been paid double. Sassa?s offices are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic and so nobody is available in person to handle queries. People can only call the helpline.

Municipality purchased hand sanitizers at R175 per 500ml bottle and paid R50 per face mask through a tender,"Chris Hani District Municipality (CHDM) has procured hand sanitisers for its staff at R175 per 500ml bottle, pricing some have criticised as excessive. The municipality paid R50 apiece for surgical face masks, which normally sell for less than R20. The company awarded this work was IC Bane Trading, a company that, according to the government database, is owned by Nombulelo Mantini, a politically well-connected businesswoman. DispatchLIVE received the information from a source who said the municipality had accepted what they knew \""was not right\"". \""We have seen things happening but this is total theft and the sanitisers were way too expensive. This is what the ministers have warned about, the Covid-19 corruption. I leaked these documents for the province to know how bad this is,\"" said the politician, who wanted to remain anonymous. DispatchLIVE managed to verify the source of the documents and Mantini confirmed her company had supplied the municipality with sanitising items at the amounts charged. Her company invoiced the district municipality more than R175,000 for 500 bottles of sanitiser, 1,000 pairs of gloves, 1,000 units of soap, 500 masks, 100 buckets with a tip tap and 120 20-litre containers with tip taps. These items were invoiced to the municipality as follows: Sanitiser 500ml @ R175,00 Gloves @ R4,48 Lifebuoy soap @ R17,49 Masks @ R50,00 Bucket with tip tap @ R126,00 20-litre container with tip tap @ R140,00 The company was paid R87,500 for 500 sanitisers and R25,000 for 500 masks, among other items. Asked if her goods were overpriced, Mantini said she was not privy to the quotations submitted by other companies. \""I cannot answer your question regarding quotes ? that would be for the municipality to respond to. However I can respond regarding my pricing, which I consider reasonable,\"" she said. She explained the reasons for her prices: \""First, the sanitisers had to be bottled and the packaging is sourced from Durban. Given the period when this was required, the urgency with which those were needed among other things, one had to travel to fetch the goods from Durban, as opposed to merely ordering and receiving by courier. Secondly, other factors considered in my pricing were that prices had gone up from the supplier due to scarcity of alcohol in the country.\"" She said prices for similarly sized sanitiser bottles ranged between R145 and R175. \""So once again I believe that taking into consideration the above factors, my pricing was reasonable.\"" Chris Hani district municipal manager Gcobani Mashiyi said the municipality had followed supply chain management regulations. After the proclamation of a national disaster, National Treasury had stipulated procurement regulations during the Covid-19 period. He said the value of the products could never be compared to that of the lives that had to be saved. \""The municipality had to swiftly act to avoid a serious and unexpected situation that posed an immediate risk to health and life of CHDM citizens and its employees,\"" said Mashiyi. \""Among the service providers that were considered, the one that quoted at R175 including delivery was awarded. This decision was informed by the urgent need for sanitisers to ensure safety of staff and all our areas of operation throughout the district.\"" However, some local business owners in the district complained about the \""rip-off\"". Komani businessman Siyabulela Qwalela said it was disappointing to see companies charging big money for something that could be bought and manufactured locally. \""The normal price for that size of sanitiser bottle is R45 to R50. This is a rip-off and the municipality on their IDP says they will use local suppliers but that is not happening,\"" said Qwalela. A local businesswoman sent DispatchLIVE her company?s price list for sanitisers. The woman, who wanted to remain anonymous as she does business with the municipality, said what IC Bane had charged seemed expensive and needed investigation. \""I am selling a litre of sanitiser for R120,00 and I would have sold that 500ml for between R60 and R65 after I?d added my 30% markup. Normally, this could sell for between R40 and R50. This is corruption because this municipality should have asked other local companies to support (them),\"" said the businesswoman. An East London retailer this week was selling 500ml sanitiser for R98. IC Bane also supplied Covid-19-related goods to the Eastern Cape department of roads and transport. People, according to Mantini, had started spreading rumours that her company had received R26m from the department. \""I have not received payment from the department as yet. I?m still awaiting payment of my invoice of R259,500 ? contrary to public allegations of R26m paid to my business account.\"" Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane has instructed provincial Treasury to conduct a forensic investigation into the allegations.",search67,0
Condom shortage crisis is looming since the beginning of Lockdown,"A global condom shortage is looming as the Lockdown shutters factories and disrupts supply chains, the world?s top maker of the contraceptives said, with the United Nations warning of \""devastating\"" consequences. Over half of humanity has been confined to their homes as the highly contagious virus marches round the planet, while governments worldwide have ordered the closure of businesses deemed non-essential. Malaysia ? one of the world?s top rubber producers and a major source of condoms ? imposed a nationwide lockdown last month as infections surged to the highest level in Southeast Asia. But restrictions on the operations of Malaysian contraceptive giant Karex, which makes one in every five condoms globally, mean the firm expects to produce 200 million fewer condoms than usual from mid-March to mid-April. With other producers around the world likely facing disruption and difficulties in getting condoms to market due to transport problems, supplies of contraceptives will be hit hard, warned Karex chief executive Goh Miah Kiat. \""The world will definitely see a condom shortage,\"" said Goh. \""It?s challenging, but we are trying our best right now to do whatever we can. It is definitely a major concern ? condom is an essential medical device. \""While we are fighting, there are also other serious issues that we need to look at,\"" he said, adding he was particularly worried about supplies of condoms to developing countries. UN sounds alarm Karex, which supplies condoms to many companies as well as governments and for distribution by aid programmes, had to close its three Malaysian factories for a period at the start of the country?s lockdown, which is due to last until April 14. The company has since been allowed to resume operations but with only 50 percent of its usual workforce, and Goh wants permission to ramp up production. \""Border closings and other restrictive measures are affecting transportation and production in a number of countries and regions,\"" said a UN Population Fund spokesperson, adding they were taking steps such as adding extra suppliers to support urgent needs.",search67,0

EFF becomes first South African political party to reach 1 million Twitter followers,"Durban ? The EFF has become the first South African political party to reach 1 million followers on Twitter, leaving the governing ANC and the official opposition, the DA, in their wake on the popular social media platform. The EFF reached one million followers this week, while the ANC trails behind with 768 500 followers and the DA ? with 595 600 followers. The EFF?s closest rival, the ANC, trails by some 230 000 followers. The EFF was founded in July 2013 and the party elected its current leader Julius Malema to lead the party. The party?s Twitter page shows that it joined the platform in November 2012 and the party describes itself on its header on Twitter as the \""SA Government in Waiting\"". Taking to his Facebook account to celebrate reaching the milestone, former party spokesperson and EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, wrote: \""The @EFFSouthAfrica has reached a million supporters. It is the first political party in South Africa to have this population on Twitter. Hasta la Victoria Siempre! #EconomicFreedom in Our Lifetime.\"" The ANC, which joined Twitter in January 2009, has 768 500 followers on Twitter while the Democratic Alliance, the official opposition in the National Assembly, which joined Twitter in March 2009 has 595 600 followers. Political analyst Mighti Jamie said that the EFF?s milestone demonstrated where the future of South Africa?s political landscape lies and that despite this huge following depicting their size it also allows them to control their own narrative in a way that other political parties were not able to. \""One million followers is one million followers and they have a bigger footprint on the digital space than newspapers and some TV stations, so this allows them to be able to circumvent mainstream media for messaging their own stuff. \""That is a useful tool for them moving into the future of South African politics,\"" said Jamie. He said that a party like the ANC has a historical support base of older voters who are not as digital and tech savvy and not on platforms like Twitter, and even though they were smaller on the internet, they remained sizable on the ground. \""The demographic of the future, which is that 20 to 40 year old demographic seems to have been actively captured by the EFF, more so than any other political party. \""This is a demographic that the DA and other parties are also competing for so the fact that the EFF has been able to capture market share on the internet, independent of its political figure head is critical because very few politicians are at the one million level,\"" Jamie said. He said reaching one million Twitter followers showed that the EFF, as a brand, had proven itself and even established a powerful digital corporate identity. \""Even though the internet is not real life people often ignore that certain demographics are very active on those platforms and quite accurately reflected on those platforms, if we even go a bit lower and you?re looking between the ages of 15 and 40, a large part of the youth demographic is very active on Twitter. \""The fact that the EFF has been able to become the winner in terms of the digital constituency on Twitter gives a stronger indicator of where they?re going in the future,\"" said Jamie. He added that this followership that the EFF has, may even be lower than their actual membership numbers because some people were afraid to follow the EFF because it reflected on their employers? checks, so it may very well be that they have more support. The IFP, the fourth biggest political party in the National Assembly with 14 seats, has just 6234 Twitter followers since it joined the platform in January 2016.

Mandisa Mashego resigned as EFF Gauteng Chairperson and member of Legislature.,"Gauteng EFF leader Mandisa Mashego dropped a bombshell when she resigned from her provincial chairperson position on Monday. Mandisa has also resigned as the red beret brigade?s caucus leader in the Gauteng provincial legislature and as a member of the legislature. The well-known leader is now an unemployed ordinary member of the EFF. Mandisa?s resignations from her leadership position and plum job are akin to the exit strategy used by musician Benny Mayengani. Mayengani first resigned from his job as EFF councillor in the City of Johannesburg last year after complaining that the party leadership chose his fellow artist Ringo Madlingozi over him to become one of the party?s 45 members of parliament. Mayengani later resigned from the EFF and was unveiled as an ANC member by Limpopo premier and ANC provincial chairman Stan Mathabatha during the party?s January 8 celebrations in Limpopo. Mashego?s shocking resignation was revealed by two Gauteng EFF members who did not want to be named because they are not allowed to speak to the media. \""She resigned on Monday. The resignation letter, which is two pages, was sent to our secretary-general Marshall Dlamini and commander-in-chief Julius Malema on Monday,\"" said the EFF member. The other member also confirmed Mashego?s resignation. \""The leadership has accepted her resignation with open hands. We know this is the same modus operandi used by Benny. We are expecting her to resign as a member and leave the party in the not-so-distant future.\"" The member also said the resignation is likely to send Gauteng EFF into a special provincial conference or early conference to elect a replacement for Mashego. Mashego first hinted to her supporters about her planned exit when she removed all her personal belongings from her legislature office three weeks ago amid simmering tension with Malema. So serious had been the tensions that Mashego didn?t even accompany Malema and former party spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi to Parktown Boys? High pupil Enoch Mpianzi?s funeral in Joburg a few weeks ago. The member said Mashego?s resignations were precipitated largely by a tweet posted by Malema last month in which he told former Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba that he was aware that two of his provincial chairpersons were talking to him in a bid to join Mashaba?s new party. Malema encouraged Mashaba to expedite the negotiations with the chairpersons, whom he did not name, so that they could swiftly leave the party. \""I?m told one or two of my provincial chairpersons, one from the inland province and one from the coastal province, are also speaking to you. Please speed up the process,\"" read the tweet. The members said Mashego took umbrage at Malema?s tweet as she construed it to mean that she and EFF Kwazulu-natal leader Vusi Khoza were talking to Mashaba. Mashego was the only inland EFF leader who didn?t support Malema?s #matorokisi slate at the party?s elective conference in December while Khoza also did not toe the party leader?s line. Mashego?s faction wanted her to be secretary-general but was pipped to the post by Dlamini. Mashego declined to comment. EFF spokesman Vuyani Pambo said they have not yet received Mandisa?s resignation letter. -Sundayworld",search67,0
Warrant of arrest issued for Jacob Zuma over non-attendance at court,"The KwaZulu-Natal High Court has acceded to a request from the state to issue an arrest warrant for former president Jacob Zuma over his non-attendance at his corruption trial.

In court on Tuesday, the State asked Judge Dhaya Pillay to issue an arrest warrant for Zuma after his legal team applied for him to be absent from proceedings in Pietermaritzburg, citing ill health. Zuma?s legal team submitted documents to the court, saying the former president was ill and had not been in the country since January 23. State prosecutor Billy Downer, however, has requested information from the defence regarding Zuma?s ailments, which they have yet to receive. The State also raised questions over Zuma?s medical note submitted to the court. Attorney Dan Mantsha, for Zuma, said his health matter was one of national security, and that his doctor was attached to the military. \""It is absurd for the State to doubt admissibility of the medical note stamped by our own military official,\"" Mantsha said. Judge Dhaya Pillay also questioned alterations on the sick note, asking why dates were apparently changed.

Downer said the warrant could be issued but the actual arrest left pending until the court had undertaken an investigation into Zuma?s absence. \""Zuma?s absence is disappointing, we want Mr Mantsha to tell us what the illness is and why Zuma can?t be here. It is a criminal offence for the accused not to be present if he has been warned in court. The court would have to enquire into reasons for his absence,\"" said Downer. He asked that the warrant be issued at the end of Tuesday?s proceedings. Downer also said that if Zuma chose to speak of his illness in closed proceedings, the State would not object. Mantsha countered that Zuma?s illness was a matter of \""state security\"" and the purvey of military doctors. Zuma was also not able to appear before a sitting of the commission of inquiry into state capture last year because of illness. He has been seeking treatment outside the country. The matter continues. African News Agenc/ANA",search67,0
"DD Mabuza says Gordhan \""lied to Ramaphosa\"" on load shedding","The deputy president of the ANC and the country, David Mabuza, said President Cyril Ramaphosa was misled when he was told there would be no load shedding before the January 13. The country has been hit, yet again, by a round of rolling blackouts, despite promises from Ramaphosa that there would be no load shedding throughout the festive season. While out interacting with people during a walkabout in Diamond Pavilion Mall in Kimberley, where the ANC is hosting its annual January 8 celebrations, Mabuza was asked about government?s response to the latest wave of power cuts. \""They?ve misled the president, but right from the day we went there with the president I insisted on maintenance. Maintenance of these power stations is very important,\"" Mabuza told journalists when asked if Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and the Eskom board had misled the president. The deputy president said the Eskom board had been \""struggling to get things right\"", noting that there was the added challenge of operating without a full-time chief executive at one stage.

"Precious Ramabulana murder accused found with her cellphone, bloody clothes and a sharp object","A 28-year-old man, arrested for the murder of Precious Ramabulana, was allegedly found in possession of her cellphone, bloodstained clothes and a sharp object, said the family. The Capricorn TVET College student was brutally murdered about 2.30 on Sunday morning. National police spokesperson Brig Vishnu Naidoo said the man was arrested at his parental home in Nyakelang Village, Botlokwa, on Thursday morning. He was arrested after an operation involving crime intelligence, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (Hawks) and forensic and detective services, according to police. ?We are confident that we have the right suspect in custody and that he has a case to answer to. The investigating team must be applauded for speedily apprehending the suspect,? said MEC for transport and community safety Namane Dickson Masemola. The family told TimesLIVE the man was caught after he was tracked down using Ramabulana?s cellphone. ?Police informed us that the man claimed to be Precious?s boyfriend. They tracked him down using Precious?s other phone. He removed her SIM card and inserted his, they found him with the object he used to stab her and clothes full of blood.

President Cyril Ramaphosa plotting to get rid of Sisulu in reshuffle  report,"The president is believed to be seeking to solidify his power due to his policies facing push-back from certain ANC groups. A cabinet reshuffle is believed to be in the works as President Cyril Ramaphosa struggles to implement his desired reforms amid push-back from certain factions within the African National Congress (ANC). According to a report in the Mail & Guardian, sources told the publication that Ramaphosa is considering moving Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu to the public service and administration ministry, which is considered less important. This following reports that she is planning to attempt to replace David ?DD? Mabuza as ANC deputy president. According to the publication, however, choosing to replace Sisulu could isolate the president from certain ANC structures, especially due to her familial ties to struggle icons Walter and Albertina Sisulu. The M&G further reports that if the reshuffle does take place, it will likely be under the guise of filling vacant positions, such as that of the deputy minister of mineral resources. ?When the president has decided to fill the vacant position of the deputy minister of mineral resources and energy, he will communicate his intentions and decision to the public,? was all presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko would say. A Mail & Guardian report released last Friday exposed an anonymous complaint sent to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane alleging that Sisulu is plotting to replace Mabuza. This is similar to claims made in a Sunday Independent article back in May that certain ANC groupings wanted either Sisulu or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to replace the deputy president. The recent M&G report said the complaint to the public protector accused Sisulu of appointing loyalists to her ministry as part of building a campaign to replace Mabuza. One of these appointments is believed to be that of Bathabile Dlamini, who was announced on Friday as the new chairperson of the interim board of the social housing regulatory authority. Sisulu?s spokesperson, Makhosini Mgitywa, said in an interview on eNCA the complaint was ?push-back? from those wishing to derail the important work she was doing in her department. News24 editor-in-chief Adriaan Basson incurred Sisulu?s wrath when he wrote a column following the elections in May titled ?Ramaphosa?s three biggest challenges right now?, outlining the alleged hurdles Ramaphosa will face in the coming months as ?the Zuma camp regroups to undermine and ultimately unseat him?. Basson referenced the Sunday Independent article and cited an allegedly ?strained? relationship between Sisulu and the president. ?There are different versions of the back story to this, but one theory in the ANC is that Magashule and co are betting on Sisulu?s blind ambition to become president to unseat Ramaphosa. It is no secret that the relationship between Ramaphosa and Sisulu has been strained. Do not be surprised if she does not make it back to Cabinet,? added Basson at the time. Sisulu slammed the column as ?fictitious so-called theories on the ANC leadership? on Twitter, adding that ?his theory is gathered from fake news and rumours meant to spread discord in the ANC?. Basson defended his right to express his opinion on political developments.",search67,0
WWE wants John Cena to sue Sho Madjozi for her title track John Cena,"American wrestler John Cena has been praised for embracing SA rapper Sho Madjozi, after he apparently refused to sue the star for making a song named after him. The star recently appeared on A Little Late With Lilly Singh, where he spoke about the song?s success. When asked how he knew about it, he said he had learnt about it through social media and messages from people concerned that she was mocking him or using his name for clout. ?So I woke up one day, flooded with messages like, ?man, you need to check out this link, you need to check this out right now. This girl is singing about you.? I said, ?that?s great?, and they said, ?no it?s not, this girl is making fun of you, she?s using you in a song, you?ve got to stop this?.? John said while there were calls for him to take legal action against Sho for copyright infringement, he was impressed with her. ?So, it?s two schools of thought. Yes, she?s mentioning my name and referencing what I do for a living, and I could easily be like, ?yo, that?s IP copyrighting? or I could say, ?wow, she is a South African artist and my contribution at WWE has sparked creative inspiration to someone halfway across the world?. She can do whatever she wants.? John said he doesn?t take himself too seriously and, to show support for Sho, posted her picture on his Instagram account to acknowledge her and her work. ?WWE kind of wanted me to issue a statement about it, but I didn?t want to take away her efforts and I didn?t want to make it about me. So I posted a picture of her basically saying I see you and I won?t interrupt your flow here. You have a great song and just know that I am watching you and I?m grateful.? The wrestler also announced that the song will be featured in his new film, Playing With Fire, as part of his character?s early-morning ritual.

BLF officially deregistered as political party by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC),"The Black First Land First movement (BLF) is no longer a political party.

FULL STORY: Herman Mashaba has announced his resignation from the DA and as mayor of the city City of Joburg effective,"City of Joburg executive mayor, Herman Mashaba has announced his resignation from the DA and as mayor of the city effective 27 November 2019. Mashaba?s decision comes in the wake of former DA leader, Helen Zille, winning the bid to become the party?s federal chairperson this weekend. ?I?m gravely concerned that the DA I signed up to, is no longer the DA that emerged from the weekend,? Mashaba said in a media statement on Monday. ?The election of Helen Zille as federal chair is a victory for those within the DA who stand opposed to the principles I stand for. I cannot reconcile myself with people who see race as irrelevant in the discussion of inequality and poverty in South Africa in 2019.? The position of federal chair is akin to the role of a CEO in a company, or the secretary-general of a political party, and is said to be the second-highest political position in a party after the leader. Zille?s return to the higher ranks of the DA follows many years of controversy ? particularly over her social media posts ? and conflict with senior party leaders, including Mmusi Maimane. Ahead of the DA?s federal chair vote on the weekend, several reports citing ?party insiders? speculated the Mashaba would hand in his resignation should Zille gain the position. The mayor was quoted as saying that ?right-wing elements? had infiltrated the DA. Mashaba said that the delay in his resignation is to give officials enough time to find his replacement. Zille back in the game Speaking to EWN, Zille said that it is confusing to her that Mashaba would resign over her appointment knowing her history as someone who fought against apartheid. ?Herman knows very well that I was hiding uMkhonto We Sizwe operatives in my house when he was a businessman making many billions out of hair straighteners and things,? she said. Zille said that her return to politics literally happened overnight after she was approached by people from within the party asking her to throw her hat into the race. She said that she had started a new life, and was enjoying exploring the new opportunities that had presented themselves ? but she also saw that the DA needed her. ?The issues facing the DA are enormous, and if the DA?s project fails, South Africa?s democracy fails,? she said. However, she stressed that her job was not to be leader of the party, saying that she would be a ?behind the scenes co-ordinator?, making sure that the party structures operating and interface effectively and efficiently.",search67,0

Ramaphosa reversed the appointments of senior advocates who were appointed by Jacob Zuma.,"President Cyril Ramaphosa is being taken to task for reversing the promotion of senior prosecutors who were given new jobs in the dying days of former president Jacob Zuma?s tenure. In a move that is seen as being driven by political considerations, Ramaphosa revoked the appointments of five top National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) officials whose elevation had been recommended by former national director of public prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams and signed off by Zuma in February last year. Ramaphosa claims the appointments were not ?finalised? and could therefore be revoked. Now one of the prosecutors is spearheading a court challenge against Ramaphosa. Advocate Ron Mncwabe, who was due to start his new job as Northern Cape director of public prosecutions on February 12 last year, says he finds it ?insulting? that, after 22 years of experience in the legal profession, his career progression has been frustrated by factional battles in the ANC. He also contests that the legislative provision Ramaphosa relied on to execute the reversal granted him those powers. ZUMA WRANGLING STALLS OCCUPATION Mncwabe, who is currently working as an additional magistrate at the Tsakane Magistrate?s Court on the East Rand, states in court papers that, despite getting the nod to become the head of prosecutions in the Northern Cape, he didn?t start the job because the ?political climate? was uncertain.MNCWABE?S 13-MONTH WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE STARTING DATE OF HIS NEW JOB IN KIMBERLEY ENDED IN DISAPPOINTMENT IN MARCH Other appointments affected were that of director of public prosecutions for Mpumalanga (Advocate Raymond Mathenjwa), director of public prosecutions for the Free State (Advocate Malini Govender), special director of public prosecutions for the priority crimes litigation unit (Advocate Jacobus Pretorius) and special director of public prosecutions for the sexual offences and community affairs unit (Advocate Bonnie Currie-Gamwo). Govender and Currie-Gamwo are not challenging the reversal of their appointments, and Mathenjwa and Pretorius have lodged separate challenges against the decision. Mncwabe?s 13-month wait for confirmation of the starting date of his new job in Kimberley ended in disappointment in March, when the presidency informed him that Ramaphosa had a different view. Mncwabe stated that Abrahams, after receiving Zuma?s confirmation of the appointment, called to congratulate him and sent him a copy of the decision via WhatsApp. Abrahams subsequently sent a hard copy of Zuma?s Presidential Minute to him by hand delivery through his personal assistant. ?I immediately accepted the appointment over the phone as well as by email as I saw no reason not to ? this was a formal consultation by Abrahams as the head of the NPA, and this was a call for me to continue serving our people at another level,? he said. On February 7 last year, he had a conference call with Abrahams and colleague Advocate Sibongile Mzinyathi, during which ?both again congratulated me on my then recent appointment?. However, due to Zuma?s resignation, the implementation of the decision, among many others, was put on hold until there was certainty in the country. What followed was 13 frustrating months of trying to get answers. I AM INSULTED Mncwabe, who describes himself as open-minded, told City Press on Thursday that the answer to the puzzle of his delayed confirmation emerged when a news story last week lumped him in with a faction that propped up Zuma and is apparently now opposed to Ramaphosa?s anticorruption crusade. He said being described as a lackey for any politician was ?an insult?.I FIND IT INSULTING TO BE LABELLED A ZUMA PERSON BECAUSE I AM JUST A JURIST PRACTISING LAW IN SOUTH AFRICAMncwabe He added that the allegation that he was ?captured by Zuma cannot be supported?, and there was ?no evidence that I ever acted in my career in a manner showing that I was captured by any individual. I wish that President Ramaphosa had sat down with me and had a discussion. He would then have known that I have never gone to court and made any decision in support of or against anyone when it is unjustifiable to do so.? FROM PILLAR TO POST According to email records, 10 days after Zuma resigned as head of state and Ramaphosa took the reins, Mncwabe wrote to Abrahams to ask when he would start his new job. After months of no answers, he escalated the query to former justice and constitutional development minister Michael Masutha, and eventually to Ramaphosa in March. He said he was expected to officially start his new job on February 12 last year, but learnt about two hours after the conference call with Abrahams and Mzinyathi that, in light of the political uncertainty in the country at that time, it would be best to let the dust settle before ?formal implementation?. In an email to Masutha in October last year, he said he and his colleagues ?have been waiting since then?. ?For obvious reasons, we continued to enquire about this long delay, communicating with the office of the former NDPP, and continuing to enquire to the acting NDPP,? he wrote.MY OFFICE AS WELL AS MY FAMILY ARE ALWAYS ASKING ME FOR ANSWERS, WHICH I DO NOT HAVEMncwabe He then decided to approach Ramaphosa?s office for intervention. He later learnt that, on March 11 this year, Ramaphosa was revoking his appointment. This instruction was communicated two days later to current NDPP Shamila Batohi for implementation. According to Business Day, the nonfinalisation of Pretorius? appointment may have had to do with his role in the decision to prosecute then finance minister Pravin Gordhan over the early retirement granted to then SA Revenue Service deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. That decision was reversed by Abrahams two weeks after he had made it. ?APPOINTMENT NOT FINALISED? In his Presidential Minute 69, dated March 11 2019, Ramaphosa cites section 13(1)a and section 101 of the Constitution as the legal instruments he relied on when making the decision to revoke Mncwabe?s appointment. Section 13(1)a of the NPA act deals specifically with the appointment of directors and acting directors of prosecutions and, according to Mncwabe, makes no provision as a legal instrument to reverse his appointment. Section 101 of the Constitution regulates executive decisions, providing that ?a decision made by the president must be in writing if it (a) is taken in terms of legislation or (b) has legal consequences?. In replying court papers, Presidency Director-General Cassius Lubisi said the fact that there were no formal records available of Zuma?s decision being processed to Masutha for implementation, and that the decision was not communicated privately or publicly to the appointees, means the appointment was not final. He says this means the appointment did not satisfy section 101 of the Constitution and was therefore not finalised. But Mncwabe contests that the Presidential Minute in itself constituted a formal written record and therefore satisfied the requirements of section 101. ?THE EMAILS STOPPED WORKING? Explaining the possible reasons behind the matter not being finalised at the time, Lubisi said that ?in or about early February 2018, the emails of the presidency stopped working. As such, there is no record of the Presidential Minute having been emailed back to the department. ?It is possible that hard copies were collected by officials in the justice department, however, there is no formal record in the presidency showing how [if at all] the minutes may have been transmitted to the department.? He said Abrahams informally passed Zuma?s decision on to Mncwabe because ?it is highly unusual for appointees of the president to be furnished with the Presidential Minute, which is an internal formal record of the president?s decisions. It is not ordinarily released into the public domain,? he said. Lubisi added that, while Zuma?s decisions to make the ?appointments? were duly minuted, signed and countersigned when he left office, ?news of Zuma?s decisions might have leaked [as] neither he nor the presidency ever officially informed the appointees of their appointment, whether by private notice or public announcement?. LAMOLA JOINS RAMAPHOSA According to his office, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola has also filed a notice of opposition, and ?the state attorney is in the process of acquiring legal counsel?. ?This application concerns an administrative action in the presidency ? The minister?s decision to oppose stems from the fact that the NPA needs to be equipped to be effective and operational.? The NPA referred to ?papers filed in court?. However, the president, Lamola and the NPA have some hurdles to jump over. First, Ramaphosa will have to tell the court why he filed opposing papers almost five months late ? when he filed the papers, the matter had already been enrolled on the unopposed court roll and was scheduled to be heard on January 20. His reasons include the preparations for the May 8 general elections and consultations with Lamola as the new minister of justice. Lamola will also have to explain his late filing. By next month, the court is expected to decide whether Ramaphosa?s reasons for the condonation of delayed filing of papers were valid. However, the application would no longer be listed on the unopposed court roll and a new date for the hearing would have to be determined. Mncwabe hopes this matter will be treated as urgent.",search67,0
EFF beats Gordhan  Equality Court dismisses application to remove rogue unit report,"A report by the Inspector General of Intelligence on the so-called Sars ?rogue unit? will remain in court records and the public domain. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have won a victory against Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan at the Equality Court sitting in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Monday. An application brought by Gordhan to have a report by the Inspector General of Intelligence on the so-called Sars ?rogue unit? removed from court papers has been dismissed by Judge Roland Sutherland. The party has released a statement welcoming the ruling. ?EFF has just won against Pravin Gordhan at the Equality Court in his challenge to have the Rogue Unit Report of the Inspector General removed from the case; IGI report will be included. Judge Southerland [sic] has dismissed Gordhan?s Application. ?The EFF welcomes the dismissal of Pravin Gordhan?s application by the Equality Court that the Inspector General of Intelligence Report on the SARS Rogue Unit be removed from court papers. ?This means the IGI Report on the SARS Rogue Unit is part of the court records and now public. We welcome the opportunity given by this judgement for the IGI Rogue Unit Report to be deliberated in the open public court. ?Both a chapter 9 institution, in the form of the Public Protector and a Chapter 11 institution in the form of the Inspector General for Intelligence have found that Pravin Gordhan ran an illegal Intelligence Unit within SARS. They determined that he must be criminally prosecuted. ?Today?s judgment is a victory of accountability against an individual who feels above the law,? according to the party. In July, the North Gauteng High Court suspended Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane?s sanction of him following her report accusing him of violating the constitution through his involvement in the so-called ?rogue unit?. Gordhan welcomed the judgment at the time and and reiterated that he believes her to be unfit for her post. In a statement, the minister said he ?doubts the competence, integrity, legal literacy and constitutional grasp of its incumbent, of her powers, duties and functions.? The statement said the ruling by Judge Sulet Potterill confirmed that Mkhwebane had failed to explain the special circumstances she relied on to entertain a complaint on a matter that happened more than two years ago, as required by the legislation governing her office.

Police raid Nigerian baby factories and free 19 women and 4 children,"Nigerian police have freed 19 pregnant women from ?baby factories? in Lagos. According to reports by the BBC, the women are lured by the traffickers who then rape them and force the young women to have babies. These babies are then sold for human-trafficking purposes. A baby boy is reportedly sold for $1,400 (about R21,000), and a baby girl is sold for $830 (about R12,500). Four children were also rescued from the premises. IN S.A ?Human trafficking? brothel shut down in Kensington An illegal brothel has been shut down in Kensington, Johanesburg after the police were alerted by an informant on Tuesday night. Police spokesperson Capt Richard Munyai said the incident happened on Tuesday evening at around 10pm. ?A 26-year-old woman came into the station and reported that there activities of physical and online forced prostitution happening in the house,? said Munyai. Munyai said when police arrived at the house, they found seven other women who were kept there. ?We also found a 17-month-old baby girl who was not supposed to be in such an environment,? said Munyai. Munyai said the women alleged that they were recruited by a South African woman who is married to a Nigerian man. ?When they got to Johannesburg they realised the job they were promised was something different,? said Munyai. Munyai said the women were removed from the house where the brothel was operating. Munyai said the police are investigating the and searching for the owner of the house to find out if he is not linked to cases of human trafficking.",search67,0
State capture: New serious allegations surface against Ranjeni Munusamy,"New allegations surfaced against journalist Ranjeni Munusamy at the state capture inquiry in Johannesburg on Monday, with a former crime intelligence officer testifying how he facilitated repairs to her car. He had the tyres replaced, serviced the car and fixed a faulty radio. This is according to former Crime Intelligence officer Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo who said he met Munusamy ?about two or three times? in 2008 to facilitate repairs to her car. Naidoo, who is currently in witness protection, told the commission he was acting on former Crime Intelligence boss Mulangi Mphego?s instructions. He was testifying about his knowledge of journalists who were working closely with Crime Intelligence at the time. He did not name other journalists in his testimony Monday morning. ?The third instance I know of, is a female journalist Ranjeni Munusamy. In this instance, I have more detail because I was personally involved. ?During 2008, I was called by Mphego to his office. He said he has this contact, her name is Jenny, and she is having problems with her vehicle and I must make contact with her and see how we can help her. I went to (Solomon Lazarus?s) office and explained what was required of me,? he said. ?I can?t recall if Lazarus explained to me who this person was but I can confirm it was indeed Munusamy who I met. I met her on two or three occasions. Lazarus told me I should take the vehicle to New World Motors. It is a service provider to Company X [a company used as a front for Crime Intelligence].? He said he met Munusamy at an Engen garage not far from her house. ?She handed over the keys and I took the car to New World Motors. The tyres on that specific vehicle was replaced, it was serviced, the radio was faulty, and one of the seats on the car needed some attention,? he said. His testimony will continue after the tea break. Two weeks ago, the Zondo commission heard testimony by Hawks officer Col Kobus Roelofse, who claimed Munusamy?s car had been paid off with money from a secret Crime Intelligence slush fund in 2008. Munusamy has denied the allegations. Tiso Blackstar Group, which owns the Sunday Times, has placed her on special leave to allow her time to deal with the allegations. The company said in a statement that Munusamy had not been engaged by any of its titles or companies during the period covered by these allegations. She only joined Tiso Blackstar in 2017, from the Daily Maverick. ?The company was unaware of any investigation involving Munusamy. At the time she was engaged as an independent contractor.? Tiso Blackstar said it had also launched an internal investigation. ?Tiso Blackstar Group notes the extremely serious allegations against journalist Ranjeni Munusamy disclosed by two witnesses before the Zondo commission of inquiry,? the statement said. ?We adhere to the doctrine of presumption of innocence until proven guilty and the principles of natural justice that include hearing both sides of the story. However, we have granted her special leave considering the gravity of these allegations. ?The company will make a final decision on this matter following the conclusion of its own internal investigations, taking into consideration the company?s interests, its policies and Munusamy?s rights.? Two weeks ago, Munumsay denied Roelofse?s allegations that R143,621.78 was used from a slush fund to pay off her car. ?I deny the allegations made against me? They are baseless. I am working with my lawyers to draft a response to the allegations for the commission, with whom I am cooperating fully,? Munusamy, the group?s associate editor, said in a statement.",search67,0
EFFs Julius Malema credited with helping Robert Mugabes family with burial wishes,"Robert Mugabe?s nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, has credited EFF leader Julius Malema for pushing Zimbabwe?s government to honour his uncle?s burial wishes. Mugabe died in a Singapore hospital on September 6 and was buried on Saturday. On his website, Zhuwao thanked Malema for an interview he did in Zimbabwe in which he pushed the government to honour the former president?s wishes to be buried in his hometown in Zvimba instead of at Heroes Acre in Harare. This despite Zanu-PF accusing Malema of demeaning the legacy of Mugabe and taking cheap shots at Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa. ?Thank you to the EFF and its Commander in Chief Honourable Julius Malema for consoling us and assisting the family of the late President Mugabe to have his wishes honoured on where he would like his mortal remains to be interred. ?After the family of the late President Mugabe expressed its desire to proceed with his burial in Zvimba, the government of Zimbabwe, in its press release dated 26 September 2019, indicated that it is co-operating with the family. The government of Zimbabwe will render all the necessary support to give the late President Mugabe a fitting burial led by the family,? said Zhuwao. Zhuwao also extended his appreciation to the ANC?s KwaZulu-Natal premier, Sihkle Zikalalala, former president Thabo Mbeki and President Cyril Ramaphosa. ?Gratitude also goes to the EFF for celebrating the late President Mugabe?s legacy at the first public memorial service on 12 September 2019 addressed by Honourables Malema, Kasukuwere and Zhuwao. ?Gratitude also goes to the ANC?s Kwa-Zulu Natal Provincial Executive led by Premier Sihle Zikalalala for honouring President Mugabe as a member of the ANC during his days at Fort Hare University. ?The ANC?s memorial services were addressed at the highest levels by [former] president Mbeki and Honourable Minister Kasukuwere on 17 September, and by President Ramaphosa and Honourable Minister Zhuwao on 20 September 2019.

Senior DA leaders are demanding answers from Maimane on who pays his rent.,"Senior DA MP Mike Waters has requested documentary proof that party leader Mmusi Maimane is renting his Claremont home out of his own pocket, the Sunday Times reports. The request is said to have been made at a meeting of the party?s federal executive last week. ?He [Waters] proceeded to ask how much he [Maimane] pays for rent, whether or not that amount is market related, and went as far as demanding that he produce bank statements to prove that,? the publication reported. This follows a City Press report two weeks ago that Maimane had declared a R4m house in the Cape Town suburb in a parliamentary register, despite the home never belonging to him. In the report, Maimane apparently did an about-turn and said he rented the house from a friend, identified in the story as business person Wessel Jacobs. Maimane had declared that house, as well as a house in Weltevredenpark in Roodepoort, Gauteng, but the deeds office reportedly stated that he only owned the Roodepoort property. The City Press report led to questions about why Maimane was renting a private home and not living in the parliamentary village. His spokesperson Solly Malatsi told News24 previously that this was due to ?security risks?. The Sunday Tribune recently reported that Jacobs had indeed confirmed that Maimane was renting the house, saying ?Maimane is renting the property from the company at a market-related monthly rental. He (Maimane) pays the market-related rental as per his agreement with the company.? On Sunday morning, Maimane took to Twitter, seemingly responding to the report in the Sunday Times, as well as an article in Rapport about his use of a rental vehicle paid for by disgraced former Steinhoff chief executive Markus Jooste.

"Tito Mboweni issues stark warning to ANC NEC, sticks to plan to sell state-owned companies","In defence of Treasury?s plan to grow the economy, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni warned the African National Congress National Executive Committee (NEC) that government?s choices are becoming starker, and that urgent changes are needed. In Mboweni?s presentation, during the third day of the NEC?s conference in Boksburg, he said growth is faltering and tax revenue has disappointed despite tax hikes, including the VAT increase. In a weak economy, Mboweni said, businesses are struggling to cope with the higher tax burden and South Africa?s lack of competitiveness. He said the outlook for growth has worsened significantly since the February Budget, and that growth is likely to remain below 2% ?for at least the next two years?. Weak economic growth ?Slow progress to date on structural reforms means growth will remain low,? Mboweni said in his presentation at the NEC, which has been leaked to Fin24. Mboweni said that state-owned enterprises (SOEs), e-tolls, the National Health Insurance and the Road Accident Fund are all placing demands on government finances. He warned that SOEs posed a ?massive risk to economic stability and fiscal sustainability?, with Eskom?s total debt now the equivalent to 9% of GDP ? the same size as the mining and agriculture sectors combined. In a low growth environment, fiscal choices are become starker, Mboweni warned. A reliance on tax increases, and more government spending (particularly on civil servant wages), will hit growth. ?If no corrections occur, in a slow growth environment, we face even greater adjustments in three years? time.? Mboweni also said that there is a lack of accountability for ministers, and that their performance agreements are based on outcomes that are ?poorly conceived?, with ?no actions taken against officials or ministers?. In his presentation, he also cast doubt about government?s cluster system. Mboweni defended Treasury?s policy discussion document on growth, released last month, which proposes increased support for exports, agriculture and tourism among many other initiatives. The ANC?s alliance partners, including Cosatu, have attacked the plan. But in his presentation on Sunday, he reiterated many of the more controversial aspects of the plan, including: Selling state-owned companies Mboweni said that government should ?stop subsidising inefficient SOCs [state-owned companies] to deliver services more effectively done by someone else and sell SOCs that have no clear public service mandate?. Previously, Mboweni mooted the sale of SAA, as well as Eskom?s coal-fired power stations. He blasted wasteful SOE expenditure, including large overruns on infrastructure projects and very high wages for senior officials. Mboweni said SA?s SOEs have unsustainable revenue models, with ?high prices reducing demand and a culture of non-payment becoming entrenched?, and as well as unsustainable cost bases (?wasteful expenditure; large overruns on infrastructure; very high wages for senior officials?) and insufficient accountability (?government not enforcing shareholder discipline; board of governors not appropriate?). Mboweni said that major SOEs are abusing their monopoly position, but there isn?t yet resolution whether more competition or better regulation would help solve it. Curbing collective bargaining Collective bargaining agreements are favouring big business and big labour to the detriment of the unemployed and small business, Mboweni said. Treasury wants small businesses to be exempted from industry wage agreements. Mboweni also warned that the national minimum wage is increasing the cost of doing business in SA. ?Global competition for low-skilled work is intensifying and SA?s unskilled labour is expensive.? The bottom end of the labour market is being helped with the minimum wage, while highly skilled workers are getting paid well because of a lack of skills. ?However, workers in medium-skilled jobs, the informal sector, [and] technology-sensitive jobs have seen [a] decline in the growth of their real earnings.? Promote high-skilled immigration Mboweni said that high-skilled immigration should be promoted through an ?improved immigration framework?. He also suggested the creation of a new National Bureau of Economic Research to improve the quality of policy advice, and confirmed plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund.",search67,0
The SACP is preparing to contest 2021 local government elections on its own,"The SACP is considering going it alone in a number of municipalities and wards in the 2021 local government elections, particularly those administrations that have collapsed under the control of its alliance partner, the ANC. The proposal is made in an internal discussion document drafted by the SACP ahead of its special national congress in December. It says the party will not give the ANC another blank cheque in 2021 if it fails to improve governance at municipal level. The party stands firm on not being undermined, and plans to embark on a campaign that would see them become more visible in embattled communities ahead of the 2021 local government elections. The South African Communist Party (SACP) has reiterated its wish to discontinue supporting the ANC. The party first voiced its decision in 2016, which was reiterated in 2017 in light of leaked Gupta emails, which general secretary Blade Nzimande strongly condemned. Nzimande also pushed for the blame to be placed squarely on the shoulders of former president Jacob Zuma and his son Duduzane. Deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila revealed to the Sunday Times on Friday that the party is still considering picking up the slack of municipalities and wards that have failed under the ANC, on its own, if administrative failures at the ANC do not improve. Mapaila said the party cannot be ?taken for granted? by the ANC any longer, and will not be observers in the ruling party?s imminent collapse. Not contesting the 2019 elections was a decision made at the party?s 14th National Congress in July 2017, where it faced calls from some of its structures to separate from the ANC. Although it did decide to back the ruling party, it did not dismiss the possibility of the SACP becoming its own separate party in the future. However, this decision is now resurfacing in full force, with Mapaila telling the publication that although the party remains committed and cautiously optimistic to an overhaul of the ANC, it is keeping its options open for the 2021 local government elections and the 2024 general elections, should this not occur. Rejuvenation is key to ?hasten the pace of our revolution,? Mapaila explains, adding that the SACP would be able to facilitate in rebuilding the country by bringing said rejuvenation. The party stands firm on not being undermined, and plans to embark on a campaign that would see them become more visible in embattled communities. Mapaila explained that monthly door-to-door ?blitzes? focussing on key challenges, such as housing, poverty, the environment and gender-based violence, will assist the party in becoming more involved with its future voters. One municipality that will garner much visibility and community aid initiatives would be the Metsimaholo municipality in the Free State, which is currently being run by SACP mayor Lindiwe Tshongwe, and has been identified as a focus point come 2021. Tshongwe?s tenure, however, is based on a coalition, which is reportedly currently shaky and plagued by no confidence votes, which Mapaila says is because of the mayor?s critical view of corruption, as well as instability within the ruling party. Work still needs to be done to successfully contest the upcoming elections, which depends on the SACP?s ability to contribute to clean government, gain support of a left front, ensure that its community is mobilised, and ideological maturity, Mapaila emphasised. The party has long lost faith in the ANC, making the long-anticipated move to stand on its own purposeful and far more serious than when calls were first made to do so in 2016.

No indication of money laundering was found on CR17 Campaign Donation,"The Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), which has become central to the Public Protector?s adverse findings against President Cyril Ramaphosa, did not find any evidence of money laundering related to the president. In July, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament when responding to a question about a R500 000 donation to his 2017 ANC presidential campaign. Mkhwebane recommended that the campaign be investigated for money laundering. But Ramaphosa has taken that report on review and has argued that Mkhwebane overstepped by expanding her investigation from the R500 000 donation to the financing of his entire campaign. READ | Ramaphosa: FIC gave Mkhwebane far more CR17 information than what she requested At the centre of that dispute is the FIC, which gave Mkhwebane information on the bank accounts concerned. Earlier this month, News24 reported that, in court papers, Ramaphosa?s lawyers accused the FIC of acting unlawfully because they allegedly gave Mkhwebane more information than what she needed to investigate the donation. The FIC has now entered the fray directly and, in an affidavit filed at the high court in Johannesburg on Friday, FIC director Xolisile Khanyile denied that the centre had acted unlawfully. Khanyile also said in her affidavit that the FIC had told the Public Protector?s staff that it had not found evidence of money laundering ? adding that this was not the FIC?s mandate, nor was this finding in any way conclusive. ?The FIC maintains that it, at all times, acted in good faith, entirely neutrally, and in accordance with the FIC?s standard operating practice. The FIC has been at all times scrupulously neutral,? Khanyile said in her affidavit. The FIC wants the court to allow it to intervene in the review application and the matter will be heard on October 3. Khanyile set out a chain of communication with Ramaphosa?s lawyers in which the FIC was accused of obtaining information unlawfully. The FIC then decided that the dispute should be ventilated in court. In her affidavit, Khanyile also said that, in the process of obtaining the information Mkhwebane sought, the FIC encountered a number of ?regulatory? reports into the bank accounts in question. This was done in terms of legislation which requires banks and businesses to report suspicious transactions to the FIC. It was on this basis that the FIC expanded the scope of the information it eventually gave to Mkhwebane, Khanyile said. ?The FIC denies that it acted unlawfully in providing the information it provided to the Public Protector.? Evidence vs intelligence She added that the FIC does not provide ?evidence?, but provides ?intelligence? ? an issue which is of ?fundamental importance?. The FIC provides analysis of the information it provides, and is not just a ?post box? for information it receives and passes on, she explained. ?The requesters might as well just subpoena the banks and be done with it, ? there would be no analysis, no value add provided by the FIC?? she said. After the FIC handed its report to the Public Protector in April, the FIC analyst who compiled it asked via e-mail to see the investigator at the Public Protector on the case, Rodney Mataboge. According to Khanyile, this is a normal step taken to ensure that the recipients of its reports understand the contents thereof. ?At that meeting, Mataboge specifically asked for confirmation on whether or not evidence of money laundering was found,? Khanyile said. ?No indication of money laundering? ?Muller informed him that he could find no indication of money laundering as he could not identify any predicate offence from which the monies could have been proceeds of.? Khanyile said that she wanted to ?emphasise? that the FIC does not have investigative powers. ?It collects information, interprets and analyses it for the purposes of assisting the legislated entities which have such powers to conduct their own investigations. ?In this regard the FIC?s findings on the existence or not of the predicate offence are not conclusive as it did not investigate whether or not such predicate offence existed. The conclusions were solely based on the fact that the amount of R500 000 came from sources that appeared to be lawful,? Khanyile said. She said the Public Protector was ?duty bound? to do her own investigations after receiving the FIC report.",search67,0
Mkhwebane on FIC request: Ramaphosas lawyers litigating through the media,"Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says President Cyril Ramaphosa?s lawyers are litigating ?through the media?, after it emerged that the president?s legal team had accused Mkhwebane of unlawfully obtaining Financial Intelligence Centre information. Business Day reported on Tuesday that Ramaphosa?s lawyers have accused Mkhwebane of unlawfully using information contained in a Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) report to make adverse findings about his CR17 ANC election campaign. The report said Ramaphosa?s team has asked the centre whether it intends to address the alleged offences committed by the Public Protector. Mkhwebane was in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday to meet with KwaZulu-Natal lawmakers when questions on the new information were put to her. ?It is so unfortunate that the same president?s lawyers are litigating through the media and it is a challenge for us as an institution. They should not be perpetuating this unnecessary litigation through the media,? she told journalists on Wednesday. A calm and terse Mkhwebane said she would address all matters in court papers. ?We will address those issues when we prepare our response to court and we will present our position as far as that is concerned. This is a matter of law. ?The journalists should focus on what the law says about the conduct of our leaders and the issue of good governance, transparency and accountability, instead of us focusing on these issues and litigating through the media.? ?Good governance? Mkhwebane said that her office was meant to support and strengthen democracy. ?We are not here to be antagonistic toward government. We are here to help them in making sure we have a country which is run through the process of good governance, transparency and accountability.? She said officials and politicians had to be accountable. ?They are accountable as servants of the people because they are placed there by the people, therefore they need to be accountable to the people. As an institution we are here to bring those issues to their attention.? Mkhwebane is currently on a roadshow in KwaZulu-Natal to engage members of various government executives.",search67,0
KZN man released after spending 13 years in jail on wrongful rape conviction,"ON the day Njabulo Ndlovu walked out of Westville Prison, the only thing on his mind was tucking into a home cooked meal prepared by his mother and a warm bed. But not before saying a small prayer and thanking the Almighty for his release on Monday. Ndlovu, 35, was wrongly convicted of rape and was forced to endure prison life for 13 years until his innocence was eventually confirmed in court last week. When Ndlovu arrived at his home in Umlazi?s J-Section, to his surprise a welcome home celebration had been planned and drew relatives and friends who he?d not interacted with in a long while. ?Walking out from that place (Westville Prison) made me feel like I was born again,? Ndlovu said. A full bench of Judges at the Pietermaritzburg High Court overturned his rape conviction and sentence last week. He was among the men accused of gang raping a pregnant woman in 2002. Ndlovu was a student at the University of KwaZulu Natal?s Westville campus at the time. Through the ensuing trial, Ndlovu maintained his innocence. Judge Rashid Vahed who delivered last week?s judgment said DNA evidence had not linked Ndlovu to the crime and raised concerns about the conduct of magistrate Mike Lasich, who convicted him. On his arrival at his Umlazi home, Ndlovu said the smell of braai meat had him drooling even before he could get out of the car. ?Family and friends came out in numbers to welcome me. Everyone wanted to find out how I coped all those years in prison. They showed me love. We feasted on braai meat and pap, something I have been longing for for years. ?I?m looking forward to more of my mom?s delicious home cooked meals like Jeqe (steam bread) and sugar beans, it?s my favourite,? he said. While being back home was a joyous occasion, there was a time when his emotions got the better of him. His brother Siyabonga who he shared a close bond with and was his biggest supporter during his trial, was not a part of the celebrations. ?Siyabonga died in a car accident in 2016 and a year later his wife died, leaving behind their only child. He was always there for me and checked up on me regularly,? said Ndlovu. The death of Siyabonga and Ndlovu?s imprisonment made his parents Mbuso and Makhosazane feel as if they had no children. ?I felt lonely and miserable. Whenever I walked on the streets, I could sense people pitied me. Those were very difficult days for me and my family,? said his mother, Makhosazane. Ndlovu said he never lost hope. ?I always knew the truth would eventually emerge. Being in prison was tough but I knew I had to survive. Worst of all was the effect it had on my parents. I am grateful that they never gave up on me,? said Ndlovu, who achieved a law degree from Unisa in prison. ?There was a time when I hated the law profession especially when I thought how it failed me. My passion for law was driven by my father?s unfair retrenchment from work. I wanted to fight against injustices and make a difference in society,? he said. Ndlovu intends to sue the state for his wrongful arrest. siphelele.buthelezi@inl.co.za SUNDAY TRIBUNE",search67,0
Limpopo chief evicts foreign tuckshop owners for selling fake products,"A Limpopo traditional leader has ordered foreign tuckshop owners to leave his village ?for selling fake products?. Chairperson of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa in Limpopo, Kgoshi Letsiri Phaahla, told Sowetan last week he served notices to at least six foreign shopkeepers in his village, giving them seven days to leave, which they have ignored. Phaahla of GaPhaahla village near Jane Furse said he was approached by concerned residents who raised complaints regarding fake and expired products. Resident Wolf Machika, 62, who was renting his building to a foreign national, alleged that he was assaulted while fighting off the group which wanted to loot a tuckshop. He said the group told him they were sent by Phaahla following a written notice. ?The group, most of whom appeared drunk, came and forced their way into my yard on Thursday afternoon. ?At that time I had just arrived from fetching firewood from my farm and I had a panga in my hand. I wielded my panga towards them and they ran away,? he said. Machika said the group later returned in numbers and overpowered him. ?Some of them held my hands from the back, while others were slapping me. Fortunately, they didn?t break into the shop because it was locked. I?m renting my building out because I want to be able to feed my family. There is nothing wrong with foreign nationals doing businesses,? he said. He accused Phaahla of using a mob to attack business people in the area. ?Some of them had confessed that they had been sent by Phaahla, hence I went to police to lay criminal charges against them. I want the police to get to the bottom of this.? Police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe said a case of common assault was opened and no arrests had been made. Machika said he now lives in fear because the mob could return at any time. Phaahla denied Machika?s allegations and said he was approached by the community about fake products sold by foreign nationals in his village. ?We held a meeting two weeks ago in which community women who are doing a food stokvel raised complaints that some of their members are refusing to accept products bought in the tuckshops operating in my village. The community said they sell expired food. I then wrote a letter to these foreign nationals notifying them that they have seven days to leave the place,? he said. ?On Monday, I issued a verbal notice through my council, giving them [foreign nationals] a day to pack and leave but they still refused. I told them that their safety was no longer guaranteed because community members came to me this week showing frustrations.? Kenny Mathivha, spokesperson for Limpopo premier, condemned Phaahla?s action, saying no one was allowed to chase away people. ?We call upon the security cluster to act against people who instigate Afrophobia. As a chief, Phaahla should be playing a unifying role and not divide the community.?",search67,0
Construction on new R300 million Afrikaans university in Centurion begins,"Trade union Solidarity has started construction of its new R300 million Sol-Tech Occupational Training College campus. Funded entirely by community investments, the campus is the first major project that forms part of education and employment projects worth R4.5 billion the Solidarity Network will embark on over the next five years. According to Dr Dirk Hermann, Solidarity Chief Operations Officer, the Sol-Tech campus is world-class and on par with international institutions. ?Although our criterium is world-class, our architects succeeded to use a typical South African and specifically Afrikaans design style,? said Paul van Deventer, MD of Sol-Tech. ?Traditional architectural styles have been absorbed in the design in a modern way. The layout of the campus acknowledges in a variety of creative ways historical events and dates where artisans played an important role.? Earthworks commenced on Monday (16 September), and the campus is expected to open its doors in January 2021. Solidarity said that its next major project is the construction of the Akademia campus where education will be offered through Afrikaans as the medium of instruction. Projects included in the Solidarity network pipeline include: A comprehensive alternative school system, An occupational training, A university, Financial aid for education, A youth movement, A network of occupational guilds, Mentorships; Job placement; Protection in the workplace; Continued education. How it is being funded Hermann said that the strength of Sol-Tech and of its new campus lies in the fact that it is being built by the community. ?Every Solidarity member donates R10 to a Building Fund each month,? he said. ?Thousands of members of the public donate smaller amounts each month to make the building of institutions such as Sol-Tech possible. ?What we see here is not the product of state money or major empowerment money but of small contributions by the thousands adding up to make something big happen.? Hermann added that the union was calling on people to join the group in working for the huge building projects. ?The only way we can ensure a future is to build it ourselves. In less than two years and a million bricks later we will have a campus here where young people will be equipped to stay in South Africa and to be free, safe and prosperous here,? he said.",search67,0
Hlaudi Motsoeneng said his plan was to capture the Gupta Family.,"Johannesburg ? Former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng on Tuesday refused to apologise for having close links with the controversial Gupta family. Testifying at the commission of inquiry probing state capture on the demise at the SABC, Motsoeneng said his plan had been to ?capture? the family, but gave no further explanations as to what he meant by this. He also admitted to meeting the Guptas, and threw in a humorous comment saying their (Guptas?) curry was delicious. Giving further testimony, Motsoeneng maintained that his former boss, SABC chief executive Lulama Mokhobo, had been dishonest in her testimony last week when she claimed that she was unaware that when she visited the Saxonwold compound, it belonged to the family. ?She knew where we were going,? Motsoeneng said. Motsoeneng, who worked at the SABC as a journalist and a producer before assuming a senior position, has since established his own political party, the African Content Movement, after he was axed from the public broadcaster. He again used the commission to deny any responsibility for the collapse of the broadcaster, saying those who had hired him two decades ago and later as chief operating officer were well aware that didn?t have a matric certificate. ?I was headhunted,? Motsoeneng maintained. He said that it was an insult for people to say he lied about passing matric. The former executive said he was approached by another colleague at the broadcaster by the name of Alvin Kloppers, who was in charge of current affairs and news. He maintained that he had declared from the onset that he did not have his matric, but the SABC put him on a course to learn about broadcasting. Motsoeneng also said he was among the first people in the history of the broadcaster to be put on such a course as it did not put freelancers on the course. Motsoeneng also claimed he went to Pretoria with current SABC foreign editor Sophie Mokoena to check his matric symbols, and further denied that he had been offered the operations officer job despite being unqualified as, in his view, he was very educated and capable, and had the required skills to do the job. He is set to return to the commission on Wednesday to give further evidence. Meanwhile, the SABC on Tuesday admitted that the wrong clip for President Cyril Ramaphosa?s address to the nation, aired last week Thursday, had been an act of sabotage. In the clip, Ramaphosa is seen speaking briefly and then asking to run his line again. According to the broadcaster, the correct clip was sent to Parliament. In a statement, the SABC said it now had ?strong prima facie evidence? that indicated that the action had been well co-ordinated. It further said all three permanent employees involved in the saga had been suspended, and that one freelancer had been suspended until all due processes had been followed.

D.A to retrench partys staff members as funders ditch a sinking ship.,"Johannesburg ? An underwhelming showing at the 2019 elections, including allegations of a ?squandered? R400million campaign chest, has resulted in job losses for DA staff as funders ditch ?a sinking ship?. These new revelations come after reports last week that the party was unable to pay its staff bonuses this year because of cash-flow problems. The Star has seen a letter dated September 3, 2019, written by DA chief executive Paul Boughey, informing staff members that the party would look into cutting jobs to meet its 2021 local government ?elections objectives?, including the organisation?s ?financial obligations?. ?This is an unfortunate situation, and we acknowledge that this is a difficult time. However, it is as a result of looking at several alternatives to streamlining our operations over the last while that we have reached a decision to embark on a restructuring process,? Boughey wrote. ?We will ensure that this process is carried out with the highest level of sensitivity and it will be concluded in a reasonable manner,? he added. Sources close to the DA have revealed that party funders ?had started ditching the sinking ship? because of its almost 1.5% drop in support at the May general elections from 2014, which supposedly necessitated the slicing of jobs. It was also claimed that the DA, which apparently had a R400m war chest to fight the election, ?squandered? the money through alleged corruption, including one Gauteng field support officer who was apparently robbed twice of R60000 of party funds in separate incidents. ?The staff members were informed that the DA will be retrenching them due to party funders pulling out their financial support after the dismal showing by the DA at the May elections. ?Mike Moriarty, DA Gauteng provincial chairperson, informed the Gauteng provincial council in June that one field support officer got robbed twice of R60000 on two different occasions. This is an example of how the R400m was misappropriated,? said a source, who asked to remain anonymous. The Star directed questions to the DA?s national leadership, as well as its Gauteng and Mpumalanga structures, where the retrenchment letters were first served. Speaking on their behalf, DA communications director Mabine Seabe said the party had initiated its ?organisational review? following the May polls, as is the norm after every election. He neither confirmed nor denied the party?s elections fund amount. Seabe added that to focus on the 2021 local elections, the DA had ?to review the resources available to it and align operations accordingly?. ?This sensitive matter has been discussed by senior leadership and management, and all political staff are being consulted by the HR department and their line managers. ?The discussions are between employer and employee and therefore the specifics will remain private between the parties concerned. This process is in line with our professional and forward-looking approach,? Seabe explained. On allegations of misappropriation of funds, Seabe said the DA operated with the ?highest level of professionalism in all that it does?. ?Funding, whether from public or private donors, is managed to the highest possible standard. All campaign rand have been accounted for, and where there are outstanding invoices, consequence management has been effected,? Seabe said. @khayakoko88 The Star",search67,0
Dont fall victim of R200 WhatsApp Stokvel SCAM,"R200 WhatsApp Stokvel is a SCAM and has become extremely popular among young people. From the nationwide MMM global social financial network to ?WhatsApp group stokvels?, the amount of people who lose large amounts of money is increasing, yet people continue with it and have not learnt their lesson. The WhatsApp group stokvel has an administration person who recruits group members, charging them R200 Once the person has paid the fee they are told to bid an amount they can afford that day. Once the list of bidding money is displayed on the group chat, a name is selected and whoever bids on the amount requested by the number selected for the day, that bidder has to deposit the money into the bank account of the person who requested it and the bidding rolls over to the next day. However, many members have complained about these stokvels saying they haven?t received their money. On Thursday a lady from a group of church members told the Fever she is tired of these stokvels and wants her money. The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, said she deposited money on 16 June into one of the ?stokvel? members bank account and was told that in 48 hours she would have the money, plus interest deposited back into her account, however, until now she hasn?t received anything. ?I am really disappointed by what is happening in my stokvel group. ?The first time I was asked to deposit money I did so and the second time as well and I got the money back on both occasions, but the third time I was told to make a deposit I was given an account number with the name of the stokvel group and not that of an individuals account.? She said she waited for her money to be deposited into her account, but nothing was reflected in her account. ?I inquired from admin as to why I had not received my money and they told me I had not made a deposit, so I sent the deposit slips as proof,? she said. It has been a week now and she hasn?t received anything and has even been blocked from the group, and warns people about these WhatsApp stokvels, saying there are not legitimate and people are merely trying to get rich off other people illegally.",search67,0
"Zuma loses Hanekom spy defamation case, court ordered him to pay damages","Former president Jacob Zuma?s ?known enemy agent? tweet about former cabinet minister and ANC member Derek Hanekom was ?untrue, defamatory and unlawful?. This is according to Durban high court judge Dhaya Pillay, who on Friday ordered Zuma to remove it and publish an apology on Twitter within 24 hours. Zuma was ordered to pay damages, the quantum of which is to be determined at a future hearing where oral evidence will be led. Hanekom, the former tourism minister ? in Zuma?s administration ? was suing Zuma for R500,000 in damages after the former president tweeted in July that Hanekom was a ?known enemy agent?. Hanekom said this has caused him ?immense harm and damage? because it gave the impression that he was an apartheid spy. Zuma, in his affidavit, said there were ?common cause events? that demonstrated that Hanekom ?colluded with opposition parties that sought to remove me as president?. Judge Pillay also issued an interdict preventing him from ever again stating or implying that Hanekom is an enemy agent or a spy. She said this will not prevent him from giving honest evidence at the Zondo commission. Hanekom?s lawyers were not present. Attorney Robinson Manzi appeared for Zuma.",search67,0
Former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has died at age of 95,"Former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has died, according to reports. He was 95. According to ZimLive, the news was confirmed by two sources. He reportedly died in a hospital in Singapore on Friday morning. According to The Mirror, Human Rights Watch Southern African director Dewa Mavhinga revealed that credible family sources said the former leader had died. BBC News also confirmed Mugabe?s death. Mugabe served as prime minister of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987 and then as president from 1987 to 2017. Tributes started pouring in on Friday morning. Fadzayi Mahere, Zimbabwe?s Education, Sport, Art and Culture Secretary, tweeted: ?Rest In Peace, Robert Mugabe. My response to your passing is complicated. I?m going to write a long piece. However, for now, deepest condolences to his family.? Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa confirmed the news on Twitter: Educated by Jesuit priests, he became a teacher before joining the liberation struggle. Mugabe, the intellectual ? with his many academic degrees ? was considered the political leader and the brains behind the guerrilla war, and was imprisoned for 11 years. Mugabe preached a message of harmony and promised to pursue a policy of inclusion for all Zimbabweans. In 1980, he said, ?The phase we are entering, the phase of independence should be regarded as a phase conferring upon all of us ? the people of Zimbabwe ? whether we are black or white ? full sovereignty, full democratic rights.?",search67,0

Covid19 body mix up: Family buried a wrong body instead of their father,"The Noda family in Eastern Cape buried a wrong body thinking that they are burying their father Vukile Noda. The funeral of burying the wrong body costed the family R13 000. This was caused because the family was not allowed to visit their covid19 patient father in hospital. These were the words of a heartbroken Eastern Cape widow who exclusively told News24 that due to a bungle at Uitenhage Provincial Hospital?s mortuary, the body of her 79-year-old husband was mixed up with that of someone else. As a result, she had to organize two funerals in the space of four days this week. Retired nurse Nomsa Noda, 67, who worked at the same hospital where her husband died, said she was shocked when an undertaker, accompanied by her pastor, visited her on Wednesday to tell her she had buried the wrong person. Her husband Vukile Noda, 79, died of Covid-19 on 22 June after he was admitted to the hospital seven days earlier. Noda claimed the mix-up happened when her husband?s name tag was put on the body of another person, who also died of Covid-19. She ended up burying the stranger at a funeral at Matanzima Cemetery in Uitenhage on Sunday. People travelled from across the country to pay their respects on the day. The mourners included her daughter Zuziwe Noda who teaches at a Rustenburg school. \""I did not even have the strength to call all those people or my daughter to tell her the man she came to bid farewell to was not her father. On Thursday, she organized another funeral for her husband and the service was attended by less than 20 people. ?He could not sleep that night? \""The second funeral service was too small because 80% of the mourners had already travelled back to their towns of residence, thinking that they had said their goodbyes to my husband. Calling and asking them to return for the right funeral would have been inconsiderate.\"" Noda said the undertaker knew about the bungle at the hospital on the Tuesday already, but did not have the heart to tell her immediately. \""He said he was scared to come immediately. He said he could not sleep that night, so he went to our pastor to tell him the news and they both came to our house on Wednesday. We buried him on Thursday.\"" \""When they came to tell us this, we could not sleep a wink the entire Wednesday night. I am so traumatized by this situation,\"" said Noda. Nyiki Funeral Directors? owner Zway Nyiki confirmed the incident and slammed the health department for creating \""chaos\"". Counsel the family \""The health department must answer because they are the ones who created this chaos. Yesterday they were doing door-to-door visits, apologising to everyone, including me and the Noda family. They must answer.\"" The pastor from the Church of God and Saints of Christ church, Siphiwo Mangena, said when Nyiki came to him with the news, he prayed and asked God to grant him strength. \""I had to counsel the family? The undertaker was too shocked and scared to break the news alone so we went together.\"" Mangena ? who was the only member of the church who could make it to the second funeral on Thursday ? said in his 17 years as a pastor, he had never experienced this. Mangena said: I prayed, sang and preached alone in front of the 10 mourners. It was very sad. A more dignified funeral was organised for the wrong person on Sunday. This was a big shock, I have never seen anything like this before. That initial funeral was well planned and had financial implications because the church members pledged and bought bouquets of flowers. The choir was there as well, thinking we were bidding farewell to a senior and respected member of our church. Noda said the mix-up could have been easily avoided. \""Initially they agreed to show us the body prior to the funeral. They said they would allow two people to view the body behind a glass wall at the mortuary. However, that did not happen.\"" Integrity, humility To make matters worse, Noda said the health department never tested her and everyone who stayed with the deceased. She added that a company had to be hired to decontaminate her Luphondwana Street house in Uitenhage?s largest township, Nobuhle. The costs for the initial funeral were R13 000. \""We chose another coffin for the second funeral and were granted another grave.\"" She said they heard that the affected family would will exhume the body she initially buried and rebury it. The Eastern Cape health department condemned the incident. Provincial health department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said: \""This is totally unacceptable and regrettable. Officials should always ensure they serve our people with integrity and humility. We condemn the negligence and there must be consequences by the management.\"" ",whatsappgroup.co.za,0

Malema wants unemployment income grants to be made permanent by government,"EFF leader Julius Malema has called on the SA government to not do away with the unemployment income grant introduced to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 but rather increase it to R1,000 \""if you want peace in this country\"". Malema was speaking during a Freedom Day online address on Monday. He further called for the increases, introduced for the next six months in the old age grant and child-support grant, to be permanent and raised further. READ: Confidential: He gave me fake money after using me for four days Malema said the unemployment income grant, meant only for the next six months and set at R350, must be upped to R1,000 and continue beyond the Covid-19 crisis. He suggested that the child grant be increased to R800 and the old age grant be topped up to R2,800. President Cyril Ramaphosa last week announced increases to social grants for the next six months to counter the socio-economic impact of Covid-19. READ: 2020 Mercedes-AMG G-Class G63: R 4 199 000 Among these, he said, there would be an additional R300 allocated to the child support grant in May, while R500 would be added per caregiver from June until October. All other grants, including the old age and disability grant, would see beneficiaries receiving an additional R250 per month from May until October. Unemployed South Africans would get a R350 basic income grant during the same period, Ramaphosa announced. READ: 2018 Rolls-Royce Wraith Wraith: R 7 950 000 Malema believes these interventions must be sustained beyond the Covid-19 impact and be increased. He did not say where the money would come from. Said Malema: \""Since our formation as the EFF we have called for the doubling of the social grants for all people in all grants that are provided by the state. \""We welcome the increase of all the social grants and the introduction of the basic income grant for all unemployed people. \""Our demand in this regard is simple, these increases must be made permanent. The old age grant must never be reduced and must instead be increased to R2,800 per month. The child-support grant must increased to be R800 per month. The basic income grant must not be reversed but must instead be increased to R1,000 per month.\"" Malema said it was important to up the grants beyond the coronavirus pandemic to increase buying power and combat poverty. This, he added, was the logical thing for government to do, \""if you want peace in this country\"".",whatsappgroup.co.za,0
Kim Jong UN is alive and well. By top security adviser to the South's President Moon Jae-in,"SEOUL ? North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is \""alive and well\"", a top security adviser to the South?s President Moon Jae-in said, downplaying rumours over Kim?s health following his absence from a key anniversary. \""Our government position is firm,\"" said Moon?s special adviser on national security Moon Chung-in, in an interview with CNN. \""Kim Jong Un is alive and well.\"" The adviser said that Kim had been staying in Wonsan ? a resort town in the country?s east ? since April 13, adding: \""No suspicious movements have so far been detected.\"" READ: 2018 Rolls-Royce Wraith Wraith: R 7 950 000 Conjecture about Kim?s health has grown since his conspicuous absence from the April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather Kim Il Sung, the North?s founder ? the most important day in the country?s political calendar. Kim has not made a public appearance since presiding over a Workers? Party politburo meeting on April 11, and the following day state media reported him inspecting fighter jets at an air defence unit. His absence has unleashed a series of unconfirmed media reports over his condition, which officials in Seoul previously poured cold water on. READ: 2020 Mercedes-AMG G-Class G63: R 4 199 000 \""We have nothing to confirm and no special movement has been detected inside North Korea as of now,\"" the South?s presidential office said in a statement last week. Daily NK, an online media outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, has reported Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure earlier this month. Citing an unidentified source inside the country, it said Kim, who is in his mid-30s, had needed urgent treatment due to heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue. READ: Confidential: He gave me fake money after using me for four days Soon afterwards, CNN reported that Washington was \""monitoring intelligence\"" that Kim was in \""grave danger\"" after undergoing surgery, quoting what it said was an anonymous US official. Previous absences from the public eye on Kim?s part have prompted speculation about his health. In 2014 he dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, the South?s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle. ",whatsappgroup.co.za,0
Ward councillors accused of stealing food parcels meant for the poor,"Durban ? Communities throughout KwaZulu-Natal have accused government officials and ward councillors of corruption in the distribution of food parcels meant for poor communities. Some councillors have been criticised for looting food parcels and for distributing food parcels along political lines. According to community activist, Mary de Haas, there are reports elected councillors were handing out food parcels meant for the poor to their families, friends and allies. She said complaints had been received in the KZN Midlands, Pietermaritzburg, Durban, Dannhauser and Nquthu. \""Among those making these allegations are political supporters who are disgusted with what is happening in their communities. These reports suggest that endemic corruption continues to dominate in government, regardless of the consequences. Divisions between the haves and have-nots are exacerbated,\"" she said. De Haas warned the likelihood was high tensions would boil over into overt violence, adding this may trigger further repression by over-stretched security forces. \""All because of the greed and corruption that continues its grip with absolute impunity, people need food to take medication,\"" she added. Congress of South African Trade Unions KZN secretary, Edwin Mkhize said they had also received reports of food parcel corruption. \""In all parts of the province, our comrades are being told about this left and right. This is just embarrassing,\"" said Mkhize. He said using ward councillors was a bad move, as many had their own political agendas. DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango said he had to use his own money to purchase food parcels for some residents in Nongoma. \""I wrote to the department of Social Development last week to ask for food parcels for some of the residents in Nongoma, to date, there has been nothing. I had to use my money to buy some for the residents.\"" He said the area is also faced with serious water shortages and he had to arrange for tankers to visit the affected areas. South African National Civic Organisation leader in the Midlands, Fanele Sibisi, said they had received complaints in wards in Msunduzi, Howick, Impendle and Mshwathi municipalities. He said the main complaint was that destitute communities were not getting food parcels and these were rather distributed to friends and comrades. \""There is also a problem with the distribution of water through tankers and jojo tanks but that is not as severe as the issue of food parcels,\"" he said. KZN Department of Social Development spokesperson, Mhlabunzima Memela said the department was aware of the allegations. He said MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called an urgent meeting to intervene. \""We have also heard that there are people that have been excluded by ward councillors from being beneficiaries of food parcels,\"" said Memela. He said they would ask the government?s flagship programme in the province, Operation Sukuma Sakhe and District Team to probe the matter. \""It is against the law. This is help from the government and it?s not political. No one should be excluded regardless of their political affiliation. We just want to ensure that needy communities do not go to sleep with an empty stomach. \""The department will meet with all relevant parties, and we are also calling upon communities to report acts of corruption by contacting the MEC or report to the mayor?s office,\"" he said Memela said those caught in the act would be violating government policy and would face the law.

"Grade 12 (Matrics) and Grade 7s could be back in school by May 6, other grades to be phased in - if lockdown ends April 30","Pupils in grades 12 and seven will be the first to return to school on May 6 if President Cyril Ramaphosa lifts the lockdown at the end of the month, according to a draft proposal seen by TimesLIVE. This is according to proposals contained in the department of basic education?s \""draft post Covid-19 lockdown recovery plan\"" which was discussed with teacher unions and governing body associations on Wednesday. According to the document, two grades will be phased in at a time, starting from May 6. These are the tentative dates for pupils to return to school: * Grades 12 and 7: May 6; * Grades 11 and 6: May 20; DOWNLOAD: Grade 11 common papers: Physical Sciences DOWNLOAD: Grade 11 study guides: Maths & Maths Literacy * Grades 10 and 5: June 3; DOWNLOAD: Grade 10 study guides: Maths & Maths Literacy DOWNLOAD: Grade 10 study guides: Physical Sciences *Grades 9 and 4: June 17; *Grades 8 and 3: July 1; *Grades 2 and 1: July 8; and *Grade R: July 15. The document stated that the phased in approach \""will be closely managed and monitored\"" and that the next two grades will be brought in based on how the school is coping with the management of the number of pupils, the space and the hygienic requirements. But it stated that schooling will only resume after the department of health has given the green light that it is safe to resume schooling. \""Given the high risk associated with large gatherings, the DBE is considering a phased-in approach. The most critical grades will be brought in first to start the primary and secondary schools, while the remaining learners are retained at home, and they are brought in on an incremental basis,\"" the document stated.

The ANC and EFF said while Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa wanted the city to part ways with the controversial and former city manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola, appointing the city?s chief auditor executive to act in his place was wrong. During the council meeting held last night in Tshwane house, The EFF continued to abstain from the process of appointing the acting city manager. Kgosi Maepa, the Leader of the ANC caucus said \""The ANC in Tshwane knows that a chief audit executive of the City should remain independent. The appointment of Ntsimane goes against acceptable international standards of the independence of the internal audit function, this is an important component of good clean governance. Maepa also said \""It is our view as the ANC that the internal audit function in the City of Tshwane should always be independent and objective in performing its work. We consider objectivity to be an unbiased mental attitude that allows internal auditors to perform their engagements in such a manner that their work product is unquestionable and the quality is not compromised.\"" He also said \""The appointment of Ntsimane undermines the latter principle of objectivity. \""This is because Ntsimane is the same person who dealt with audit reports associated with the COO James Murphy when he was nominated in July 2019 by council to be the acting city manager.\"" Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa said the ANC and EFF were made aware that there was no conflict of interest because an acting chief auditor executive while Ntsimane would be acting as city manager.

Former Water Affairs Minister spills hard at Gavin Watson Memorial," Memorial was held today at Roodepoort, Johannesburg for former CEO of African Global Operations, previously known as Bosasa Gavin Watson who died in a car crash outside the OR Tambo International Airport earlier this week. Speaking at the memorial is member of the ANC national executive committee Nomvula Mokonyane who used the opportunity to blast those in the governing party whom she said turned their backs on the late Bosasa boss Gavin Watson, saying she will reveal all when the right time comes. The former water affairs minister said \""My time will come. I will tell what Gavin has done and not what [former Bosasa CFO Angelo] Agrizzi is saying?that time will come and I will tell my story.

Some of them have gotten bigger than you, are richer than you?some of them live in bigger houses than yours and drive bigger cars.\"" She also said \""Thank you for supporting the ANC when it was not fashionable to do so. Thank you for taking care of the vulnerable in Kagiso, Northern Cape and in Limpopo. Thank you.\"" The former minister had more to spill when she said \""If you ask me why I frequented Bosasa offices, I will tell you that?s because Bosasa was friendly to the ANC. This is a family that never shied from Nomvula. They never shied away from Surge Mokonyane [late husband] the terrorist who associated with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela when it was not popular to do so. Our story will be told. Gavin was no capitalist, he loved life. On what he did with Agrizzi, only God will judge. To the family, let us hold on to that God?s prayer. I say to you Gavin, love everybody but trust no one.\"" She added that the Watsons subscribed to a just course and love South Africa. Angelo Agrizzi the former chief operating officer alleged that Watson was the mastermind behind Bosasa?s dodgy contracts with the government worth billions of rands. He said he decided to come clean and reveal all, told the state capture commission of inquiry that he was tasked with organising bribes in cash for former president Jacob Zuma, Cartier pens, a Louis Vuitton bag stuffed with banknotes for former South African Airways board chairwoman Dudu Myeni, and in the case of Mokonyane, huge orders of food and drinks for Christmas.

Ethekwini residents on the receiving end of ANCs factional war," The DA in eThekwini is deeply frustrated by the ongoing ANC chaos regarding Zandile Gumede. Gumede has now withdrawn her resignation as the City?s Mayor after initially resigning on Monday. The council meeting to elect new City leadership that was meant to have taken place today was postponed by the City Manager. Newly Released 2019 Top 50 Highest Paid PSL Stars. The City Manager has obviously postponed this meeting on the instruction of the ANC, which is completely illegal and inappropriate. The City Manager should not be taking instructions from political parties. The DA did predict that Gumede wouldn?t go quietly. We had already resubmitted our motion to remove Gumede from the Executive Committee to the former Council Speaker, William Mapena. Our legal team was consulted in this process. Mapena disallowed the motion on the basis that it would be ?impractical to perform?. This is one of the bases for disallowing motions in the rules but was misused for political reasons. We will again consult our legal teams to mount a potential challenge in this regard. Without clarity as to who is in charge, the city is at risk and is left in the lurch. Section 28 of Council?s Rules of Order prescribes that during any emergency and when Council or committees aren?t sitting, the Municipal Manager takes emergency decisions in consultation with the Mayor. This currently cannot happen and the legal status of various office bearers is unclear. A report on business in eThekwini, commissioned by the City and published some time back, showed that ?corruption? and ?poor leadership? where key reasons why Durban business owners wanted to move their businesses elsewhere. The economic effect of Gumede?s corruption and the ANC?s catastrophic handling of this matter cannot be overstated. The City?s economy has ground to a halt, with 0% growth under the current circumstances. The poor and unemployed are suffering due to ANC mismanagement. The ANC has been treating the City like its political football for too long. The biggest losers have been the residents of Durban. Service delivery has declined sharply whilst the ANC has forgotten its core mandate, and the instability and inconsistencies have created absolute chaos.

We understand that the ANC is now in the role of opposition, however it is important to note the disruptive nature of such motions. This is the fourth motion, of no substance, that the ANC has tabled in the city since 2016. In Tshwane, previous reasons given for these motions have been addressed as is the case with the reasons offered by the ANC in this instance. The DA understands better than anyone the challenges that go along with being in opposition but there is a responsibility that goes hand in hand with that. The stream of baseless motions only disrupts the business of delivering services to the people. We want to fix issues.

Since 2016, the City has reduced unauthorised expenditure by over a billion rand, taken tenders worth billions on review such as the PEU Smart Meter contract valued in excess of R2 billion, the West Capital Project, the Moipone Fleet Contract, the City Hall scandal, and the Broadband contract, slashed 900 plus ANC political appointees in the mayor?s office, allocated more than R137.2 million towards EPWP initiatives, extended clinic hours at 24 facilities and launched a Hopeline so that those affected by drugs can get help.

From October 7, electricity will be disconnected from 6am till 8pm on weekdays, until the municipality has paid all its outstanding debt. Newcastle is a prime example of how wrong things can go when there is a lack of leadership ? at both a provincial and local level.

Corruption in Gauteng SAPS on the rise; and the highest,"The Democratic Alliance (DA) is shocked to learn that there has been a marked increase in corruption within the South African Police Service (SAPS). It is disappointing that the leadership in SAPS is not doing enough to curb corruption within their organisation. Newly Released 2019 Top 50 Highest Paid PSL Stars. This information was revealed in the 2019 Analysis of Corruption Trends Report released by Corruption Watch. Furthermore, the report indicates that for the first time corruption in the police sector has overtaken other sectors like schools, health and local government. According to the report, abuse of power is at 35.7% and bribery is at 30.6% in the police sector. In an earlier report released by Corruption Watch in June, Corruption in Uniform: When Cops Become Criminals focusing only on corruption in the police sector, it was revealed that Gauteng had 52.8% corruption, the highest in the country. The DA has always said that corruption within SAPS must be rooted out as a matter of urgency, in order to create an honest and a professional police service. Trust between residents and the police have broken down because of corruption. Gauteng residents must feel safe in their homes, places of work and on the street. The only way this can be achieved is if there is a good working relationship between residents. Corruption would be easy to get rid of in SAPS if only the good cops are willing to arrest the minority bad element in their midst, however, this begins with good leadership and political will. The DA will continue to call on government to ensure that SAPS is professionalised, corruption is eradicated and that the police competency be given to the province in order to better address local needs.
